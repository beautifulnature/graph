I already take detailed notes as a part of my learning process, so I've decided to go the extra mile and publish them online, where they'll hopefully be helpful to others. Taking notes is more motivating when I know others may benefit from them.  

As I write the newsletter, I’ll use Logseq – a great outliner writing tool for organizing ideas. I’ll write my notes in Logseq, write a commentary in "newsletter" form, publish the notes and newsletter on this site, and email them to subscribers using [Substack](https://newsletter.briansunter.com/)

I hope that by sharing my work, I can be part of a conversation, learn from others, and help those interested in any of the topics mentioned above.  

You can read all the newsletters and blog posts on this site or [subscribe to the newsletter on substack](https://newsletter.briansunter.com/) to get them delivered to your inbox.
