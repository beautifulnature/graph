I'm a passionate software engineer who loves leveraging technology to solve problems and sharing what I learn.

With years of experience in the tech industry, I have developed a strong understanding of software architecture, observability, web/mobile clients, and DevOps. I'm always looking for new challenges to expand my knowledge and skills.

When it comes to my interests, I'm fascinated by programming, AI, web development, productivity, and tools for thought. I enjoy exploring new technologies and discovering innovative ways to use them in my work.

In my free time, I love to read, game, travel, and photograph the beauty around me. I also enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, paddleboarding, and keeping fit.

If you're interested in getting to know me better, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to making new connections and sharing ideas!
