# Moving to Hawaii

Hi everyone, this post is a bit of an update on my personal life.

I recently moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu with my partner, and we've been here for about four months. I have lived in San Francisco for around nine years, and moving here has been a great change of pace.

After two years of working from home in a small one-bedroom apartment during the strict SF lockdowns, we both craved more time outdoors and a chance to have fun. My main goals since moving to Hawaii have been to spend as much time as possible outside, get fit and healthy, learn new skills, and work on some new projects. It took a little while to feel settled here, but we finally found a great apartment near the beach and are starting to feel established.

One of my favorite things about living in Hawaii is the weather. It's always perfect, which has been greatly improving our well-being. Over the last two years, we spent so much time cooped up indoors that being outside has been rejuvenating. The temperature ranges from 63-85°F (17-29°C), which means we can wear shorts and T-shirts all year round.

As someone who grew up in Florida, I love warm weather, but not the extreme heat and storms. San Francisco had good weather overall, but it could be chilly, foggy, and rainy, which made it hard to motivate myself to go outside sometimes. I've been taking long walks for hours here in Hawaii, enjoying the scenery, and reading outside. I love going on a long walks in the evening without needing a jacket.

The outdoors in Hawaii are spectacular. We're constantly reminded that we're not in an ordinary place by the unique scenery around us. The volcanic ridges in the distance are particularly striking, and we have a good view of them from our apartment. I love watching the clouds and mist pass over them, and I've never seen so many rainbows.

There are some great beaches right next to our apartment, and the view of the Diamond Head crater from the beaches near me is breathtaking. I try to swim in the ocean as often as possible for exercise. I often see sea turtles while swimming and sometimes get spooked when one of their huge heads pops up for air next to me.

I've started getting into stand-up paddleboarding, which is a ton of fun (though more challenging than it looks). I'm looking forward to trying my hand at surfing soon – there are tons of surfers out at the beach, and watching them is entertaining, especially the people "hydro foiling" gliding on top of the water. The ocean temperature is really pleasant and much warmer than the frigid beaches in California.

We've been road-tripping around the island, discovering new beaches and unique scenery in every area. It's an incredible place to live if you're a fan of the outdoors, and there's always something new to explore. Living in Hawaii has been a dream, and I'm incredibly grateful to be here.

# Improving my Health and Fitness

The move was a little disruptive, but now that I'm feeling settled, I'm ramping up on a few projects. I wasn't taking care of my health as much as I should have in the past few years, so my top priority is improving my health and fitness. I used to be pretty active when walking to work and going to the gym a few times a week, but when Covid hit, and I started working from home, it threw a wrench in my fitness routine, so now I'm trying to get back on track.

My main focus has been strength training with resistance loop bands at home. I used to think free weights were the only way to build strength, but these have been really challenging and let me gradually increase the resistance by adding more and heavier bands. It also takes much less time than going to the gym, and many of the exercises feel safer than free weights when I'm exercising alone.

I've been doing long swims in the ocean at the beaches near my apartment for cardio. Swimming in open water is quite a bit more intense than in the pool and has been a great workout. There's interesting sea life and great views which keep me entertained. I also try to make it to the water at least once weekly to go paddle boarding.

I'm continuing to do Yoga every other day for mobility and mindfulness. I highly recommend the [Yoga with Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/@yogawithadriene) videos on YouTube, which I've been following for many years. I appreciate her kindness and positivity; these videos always put me in a better mood. They've been improving my overall movement and flexibility and helping me recover and reduce soreness from the resistance training.

I've been trying to increase my overall movement and time outside as much as possible. I start each day with an hour-long walk which has been great for my physical and mental health. I plan my day, think about my life, listen to great audiobooks and podcasts, and get some good early sun exposure, which has been helping my sleep and energy levels.

This is a little more personal than my previous newsletters, but I hope you enjoyed hearing more about me and what I've been up to. I'll continue focusing on my projects and learnings in future issues but will occasionally include some personal stuff as well.
