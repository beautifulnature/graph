# Summary

I'm continuing to add features to the logseq gpt3 openai plugin, my plugin that allows you to perform AI text generation tasks in the Logseq note-taking application.

I'm really interested in this new AI technology called "Large Language Models" which allows AI to understand the meaning behind text, as well as generate humanlike text.

## Logseq GPT-3 OpenAI plugin

I recently added a couple new features to the logseq OpenAI GPT-3 plugin.

### Logseq OpenAI Plugin Video

The [productivity Youtuber Shu Omi](https://www.youtube.com/@ShuOmi_Official) made a great video about my logseq openai plugin. I highly reccomend checking it out as an introduction to the plugin and AI enabled note-taking.

I've been a fan of Shu's videos for a long time while learning about notetaking, and am delighted he higlighted my plugin in one of his videos!

### GPT-3 Page

The new `gpt-page` feature sends the entire crrent page to gpt-3, which should be more convenient for certain use cases where additional context is needed to make the suggestions more accurate.

### DALL-E

OpenAI released their DALL-E image generation API. I recently incorporated this into the logseq plugin, so you can generate images inside logseq, where they are inserted into the editor and saved locally.

### Headphone Eyemask

The [headphone-eye-mask]({{< ref "headphone-eye-mask" >}}) is my new favorite sleep hack.

It's an eye mask with built in bluetooth headphones, so you can listen to podcasts while you fall sleep.

Sometimes I would stay up too late on my phone or computer, which overstimulates my brain and disrupts my circadian rhythm by beaming bright blue light into my eyes.

The headphone eye mask helps slow down my brain with a nightly ritual I enjoy and helps me get to sleep much earlier.
