## Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte

![basb.jpeg](/assets/basb_1672455079106_0.jpeg)

Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain book is a guide to developing a productivity system that helps you better manage information and improve your creativity, productivity, and ability to generate insights.

I incorporated many ideas from his book into my system, like focusing on projects, organizing by project and life areas, his summarization tips, and project checklist ideas.

> Your job as a notetaker is to preserve the notes you’re taking on the things you discover in such a way that they can survive the journey into the future. That way your excitement and enthusiasm for your knowledge builds over time instead of fading away

## The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer

![71URMFtAuQL.jpg](/assets/71URMFtAuQL_1672620377581_0.jpg)

A guide to getting in touch with your inner self. How to watch your thoughts like a TV show instead of being a character in the show. "You are not your thoughts or emotions. You are the one experiencing them."

I thought it was a good introduction to mindfulness. I liked the concept of "The Inner Roommate." Who is always dissatisfied and arguing against you, a form of anxious energy manifested as a voice in your head.

> “There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind - you are the one who hears it.”

> In case you haven’t noticed, you have a mental dialogue going on inside your head that never stops. It just keeps going and going. Have you ever wondered why it talks in there? How does it decide what to say and when to say it? How much of what it says turns out to be true? How much of what it says is even important? And if right now you are hearing, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t have any voice inside my head!”—that’s the voice we’re talking about.

> While you’re driving, you hear internal conversations like, “Wasn’t I supposed to call Fred? I should have. Oh my God, I can’t believe I forgot! He’s going to be so mad. He may never talk to me again. Maybe I should stop and call him right now. No. I don’t want to stop the car right now…”
Notice that the voice takes both sides of the conversation. It doesn’t care which side it takes, just as long as it gets to keep on talking.



## Simple Path to Wealth  by J.L Collins

![31QRvVZpizL._AC_SY780_.jpg](/assets/31QRvVZpizL._AC_SY780_1672620409758_0.jpg)

Great book for those interested in managing money and financial independence. It discourages you from trying to beat the market and suggests you invest in index funds and get rich slowly.

This book helped me develop a plan for my finances and feel good about my strategy, despite the world's uncertainty.

> “Spend less than you earn—invest the surplus—avoid debt.”

> If your lifestyle matches—or god forbid exceeds—your income, you are no more than a gilded slave.

> Avoid investment advisors. Too many have only their own interests at heart. By the time you know enough to pick a good one, you know enough to handle your finances yourself. It’s your money and no one will care for it better than you.

> Money can buy many things, but nothing more valuable than your freedom.

> Life choices are not always about the money, but you should always be clear about the financial impact of the choices you make.

> Sound investing is not complicated.

>The stock market is a powerful wealth-building tool and you should be investing in it. But realize the market and the value of your shares will sometimes drop dramatically. This is absolutely normal and to be expected. When it happens, ignore the drops and buy more shares.

> This will be much, much harder than you think. People all around you will panic. The news media will be screaming Sell, Sell, Sell!

> When you can live on 4% of your investments per year, you are financially independent.

## Authority and the Individual by Bertrand Russel

![418Mwg6YAqL.jpg](/assets/418Mwg6YAqL_1672620426734_0.jpg)

How can we combine that degree of individual initiative necessary for progress with the social cohesion necessary for survival?

A nuanced take on one of my favorite topics: the tension between the individual and society.

> You have, it is true, a twenty-millionth share in the government of others, but only a twenty-millionth share in the government of yourself. You are therefore much more conscious of being governed than of governing.

> In all social animals, including Man, co-operation and the unity of a group has some foundation in instinct. This is most complete in ants and bees, which apparently are never tempted to anti-social actions and never deviate from devotion to the nest or the hive. Up to a point we may admire this unswerving devotion to public duty, but it has its drawbacks; ants and bees do not produce great works of art, or make scientific discoveries, or found religions teaching that all ants are sisters. Their social life, in fact, is mechanical, precise and static. We are willing that human life shall have an element of turbulence if thereby we can escape such evolutionary stagnation.

> The sphere of individual action is not to be regarded as ethically inferior to that of social duty. On the contrary, some of the best of human activities are, at least in feeling, rather personal than social. Prophets, mystics, poets, scientific discoverers, are men whose lives are dominated by a vision; they are essentially solitary men. When their dominant impulse is strong, they feel that they cannot obey authority if it runs counter to what they profoundly believe to be good. Although, on this account, they are often persecuted in their own day, they are apt to be, of all men, those to whom posterity pays the highest honour. It is such men who put into the world the things that we most value, not only in religion, in art, and in science, but also in our way of feeling towards our neighbour, for improvements in the sense of social obligation, as in everything else, have been largely due to solitary men whose thoughts and emotions were not subject to the dominion of the herd.

## The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis

![screwtape.jpg](/assets/screwtape_1672620785526_0.jpg)

A religious satire defending Christianity in the form of imagined letters between a demon and his demon uncle on how best to corrupt humanity. Each demon is assigned a human for them to corrupt. A fun exploration of a usually stuffy topic.

> Nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to the present; fear, avarice, lust and ambition look ahead.

## The Gay Science by Friedrich Nietzsche

![gay-science.jpeg](/assets/gay-science_1672621370939_0.jpeg)

Aphoristic musings on a wide range of topics such as morality, religion, psychology, art, and science. Written in an energetic poetic rhapsodic style, unlike boring dry philosophy texts. Controversial and guaranteed to provoke a reaction.

> To the teachers of selfishness.— A man’s virtues are called good depending on their probable consequences not for him but for us and society: the praise of virtues has always been far from “selfless,” far from “unegoistic.”

> Preludes of science.— Do you really believe that the sciences would ever have originated and grown if the way had not been prepared by magicians, alchemists, astrologers, and witches whose promises and pretensions first had to create a thirst, a hunger, a taste for hidden and forbidden powers? Indeed, infinitely more had to be promised than could ever be fulfilled in order that anything at all might be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge”

> Against remorse.— A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions—as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all. To be annoyed or feel remorse because something goes wrong—that he leaves to those who act because they have received orders and who have to reckon with a beating when his lordship is not satisfied with the result.”

## Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson

![41ZZY5+kzLL.jpg](/assets/41ZZY5kzLL_1670306664477_0.jpg)

Collection of tweets by naval on entrepreneurship, happiness, and health. Lot's of great assorted wisdom. My favorite are the topics on "How to get rich without getting lucky". It inspired me to be more authentic and follow my passions.

> Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.

## Man's Search for Meaning Viktor E. Frankl

![mans-meaning.jpeg](/assets/mans-meaning_1672626609393_0.jpeg)

A book about man's search for meaning and purpose.

How can we find cope with suffering and find meaning? The first half is about his experiences in a concentration camp, and the second half is about his philosophy of "logotherapy." Heart-wrenching and thought-provoking.

> “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

## Apology by Plato

![socrates.jpg](/assets/socrates_1672728321436_0.jpg)

Socrates' speech defending himself at the trial, where he was condemned to death for corrupting the youth of Athens. An excellent example of greek rhetoric. Read a commentary to appreciate what he's doing fully

> He asked the oracle to tell him whether there was anyone wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered that there was no man wiser

> When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men?

> I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest.

> I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed to him and the result was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself.

> I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me

> I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.

> After this I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked

> I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that some inferior men were really wiser and better.

## Typescript Handbook

![typescript-handbook.jpg](/assets/typescript-handbook_1672627324910_0.jpg)

An excellent concise overview of Typescript explaining best practices, useful patterns, and recommended configurations. It should be required reading for everyone using typescript.

```typescript
// Type Predicates
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}

let pet = getSmallPet();
 
if (isFish(pet)) {
  pet.swim();
} else {
  pet.fly();
}

## Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls by David Sedaris

![diabetes.jpeg](/assets/diabetes_1672627569188_0.jpeg)

Hilarious neurotic bizarre, yet relatable essays by David Sedaris. The anecdotes come from observations from his personal life and the funny situations he gets in. Topics range from living in France taxidermy owls, and colonoscopies.

>I decided that because Hugh actually *did* get a kick out of owls, I would try to find him a stuffed one. My search turned up plenty of ravens. I found pheasants and ducks, and foot-tall baby ostriches. I found a freeze-dried turkey’s head attached to its own foot, but owls, no luck. That’s when I learned that it’s illegal to own them in the United States. Even if one dies naturally of a stroke or old age. If it chokes on a mouse or gets kicked by a horse. Should one fly against your house, break its neck, and land like magic on your front stoop, you’re still not allowed to stuff it or even to store its body in your freezer. Technically, you’re not even allowed to keep one of its feathers—that’s how protected they are. I learned this at a now-defunct taxidermy shop in midtown Manhattan. “But if you’re *really* interested,” the clerk I spoke to said, “I’ve got a little something you might want to see.” He stepped into the back room and returned with what I could only identify as a creature. “What we’ve done,” he boasted, “is stretch a chicken over an owl *form.*”

## Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami

![hardboiled.jpeg](/assets/hardboiled_1672628001084_0.jpeg)

The protagonist is a human data processor trained to encrypt data with his mind to protect it from criminal groups. It has two intertwined stories where he helps a mysterious scientist with a project in dystopian Tokyo and explores a strange isolated town surrounded by an impenetrable wall in his unconscious mind.

A dreamy creative "detective" book with magical realism.

> It was a long, hard job. The numerics themselves were the proverbial piece of cake, but with so many case-determinant step-functions, the tabulations took much more doing than they first appeared to require. I input the data-as-given into my right brain, then after converting it via a totally unrelated sign-pattern, I transfer it to my left brain, which I then output as completely recoded numbers and type up on paper. This is what is called laundering. Grossly simplified, of course.

>“Excuse me for asking so many questions,” I say. “I know nothing about this Town. How it works, why it needs the Wall, why the beasts are herded in and out every day. I do not understand any of it. You are the only one I can ask.”

> “Not even I know all the rules,” says the old officer under his breath. “There are things that cannot and should not be explained. But there is no cause for concern. The Town is fair in its own way. The things you need, the things you need to know, one by one the Town will set these before you. Hear me now: this Town is perfect. And by perfect, I mean complete. It has everything. If you cannot see that, then it has nothing. A perfect nothing. Remember this well. That is as much as anyone can tell you; the rest you must learn for yourself. Open your eyes, train your ears, use your head. If a mind you have, then use it while you can.”

## The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

![dorian.jpeg](/assets/dorian_1672628846521_0.jpeg)

The beautiful Dorian Gray makes an impulsive wish to stay young while his portrait remains the same, aging over time to absorb the damage of his wild life.

Genius writing and dialog that's playful and intellectual. It explores the purpose of art and our obsession with youth and beauty. I loved the Lord Henry character.

> The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

> I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.”

> Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face, and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made of ivory and rose-leaves. 
Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But Beauty, real Beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself an exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are!

> The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better in fact than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she did, but she merely laughs at me.”

> Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation. It is one of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or springtime, or the reflection in the dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it.

## Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens

![crawdads.jpg](/assets/crawdads_1672629636504_0.jpg)

A murder mystery in a small town in the marshes of North Carolina. Follows Kya's life growing up in the swamp, her passion for the natural world, how the town shuns her, and her accusation of murder.

> The morning burned so August-hot, the marsh’s moist breath hung the oaks and pines with fog. The palmetto patches stood unusually quiet except for the low, slow flap of the heron’s wings lifting from the lagoon. And then, Kya, only six at the time, heard the screen door slap. Standing on the stool, she stopped scrubbing grits from the pot and lowered it into the basin of worn-out suds. No sounds now but her own breathing. Who had left the shack? Not Ma. She never let the door slam.

> She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn't her fault she'd been alone. Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.

## Dune

![dune.jpg](/assets/dune_1672629693314_0.jpg)

A science fiction space opera centered around the desert planet of arrakis, which has spice, the most valuable resource in the universe because it gives those that use it the power to navigate open space.

> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

>Here’s a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.’
Pride overcame Paul’s fear. ‘You dare suggest a duke’s son is an animal?’ he demanded.
‘Let us say I suggest you may be human,’ she said. ‘Steady! I warn you not to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me.’
‘Who are you?’ he whispered. ‘How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?’
‘The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.’ A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.
‘Good,’ she said. ‘You pass the first test. Now, here’s the way of the rest of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.’

## Master and margarita

![master-margarita.jpeg](/assets/master-margarita_1672629817618_0.jpeg)

The devil goes to soviet moscow intertwines with the story of pontius pilate ordering the crucifiction of christ. Captures the paranoid nature of soviet era life with a huge dose of magical realism involving talking cats and flying vampires.
>Whether Pushkin’s poetry produced such an effect, or it was the prosaic speech of the master of ceremonies, in any case a shy voice suddenly came from the house:
‘I’ll turn over my currency.’
‘Kindly come to the stage,’ the master of ceremonies courteously invited, peering into the dark house.
On-stage appeared a short, fair-haired citizen, who, judging by his face, had not shaved in about three weeks.
‘Beg pardon, what is your name?’ the master of ceremonies inquired.
‘Kanavkin, Nikolai,’ the man responded shyly.
'Ah! Very pleased, Citizen Kanavkin. And so? ...’
‘I’ll turn it over,’ Kanavkin said quietly.
‘How much?’
'A thousand dollars and twenty ten-rouble gold pieces.’
‘Bravo! That’s all, then?’
The programme announcer stared straight into Kanavkin’s eyes, and it even seemed to Nikanor Ivanovich that those eyes sent out rays that penetrated Kanavkin like X-rays. The house stopped breathing.
‘I believe you!’ the artiste exclaimed finally and extinguished his gaze. ‘I do! These eyes are not lying! How many times have I told you that your basic error consists in underestimating the significance of the human eye. Understand that the tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes - never! A sudden question is put to you, you don’t even flinch, in one second you get hold of yourself and know what you must say to conceal the truth, and you speak quite convincingly, and not a wrinkle on your face moves, but — alas - the truth which the question stirs up from the bottom of your soul leaps momentarily into your eyes, and it’s all over! They see it, and you’re caught!’

## Travels with charley

![travels-with-charley.jpeg](/assets/travels-with-charley_1672052430785_0.jpeg)

John Steinbeck sets out on a road trip across 1960s America with his standard poodle, Charley, in search of "the character of the country." He interviews different Americans on current social issues, such as the cold war and desegregation.

[Read my full summary here]({{< sref "/pages/travels with charley" >}})

> I took one companion on my journey—an old French gentleman poodle known as Charley. Actually his name is Charles le Chien. He was born in Bercy on the outskirts of Paris and trained in France, and while he knows a little poodle-English, he responds quickly only to commands in French. Otherwise he has to translate, and that slows him down. He is a very big poodle, of a color called _bleu,_ and he is blue when he is clean. Charley is a born diplomat. He prefers negotiation to fighting, and properly so, since he is very bad at fighting. Only once in his ten years has he been in trouble—when he met a dog who refused to negotiate. Charley lost a piece of his right ear that time. But he is a good watch dog—has a roar like a lion, designed to conceal from night-wandering strangers the fact that he couldn’t bite his way out of a _cornet de pa-pier._ He is a good friend and traveling companion, and would rather travel about than anything he can imagine. If he occurs at length in this account, it is because he contributed much to the trip. A dog, particularly an exotic like Charley, is a bond between strangers. Many conversations en route began with “What degree of a dog is that?”

## Neuromancer

![neuromancer.jpg](/assets/neuromancer_1672630101925_0.jpg)

A cyberpunk novel about a destitute hacker hired by a powerful AI to execute a mysterious job in a dystopian world controlled by corporations and people augmented with cybernetic enhancements.

>The black clinics of Chiba were the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly, and still they couldn’t repair the damage he’d suffered in that Memphis hotel.
A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he’d taken and the corners he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless void. . . . The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he’d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn’t there.

## Mistborne book 1, the final empire

![mistborn.jpg](/assets/mistborn_1672630557858_0.jpg)

Mistborne is a fantasy novel about a dystopian world where ashes constantly fall from the sky and the lower classes are enslaved by the immortal Lord Ruler and his aristocrats. A group uses a type of magic called allomancy, where you can draw magical powers from certain metals, to fight back.

>ASH FELL FROM THE SKY.
Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. Ashfalls weren’t that uncommon in the Final Empire, but Tresting had hoped to avoid getting soot stains on his fine new suit coat and red vest, which had just arrived via canal boat from Luthadel itself. Fortunately, there wasn’t much wind; the parasol would likely be effective.
Tresting stood with his guest on a small hilltop patio that overlooked the fields. Hundreds of people in brown smocks worked in the falling ash, caring for the crops. There was a sluggishness to their efforts—but, of course, that was the way of the skaa. The peasants were an indolent, unproductive lot. They didn’t complain, of course; they knew better than that. Instead, they simply worked with bowed heads, moving about their work with quiet apathy. The passing whip of a taskmaster would force them into dedicated motion for a few moments, but as soon as the taskmaster passed, they would return to their languor.

## Exhalation

![Exhalation.jpg](/assets/Exhalation_1672630657446_0.jpg)

A series of short science fictions exploring philosophical topics, such as time travel, free will, entropy, and artificial intelligence. Extremely creative with a wide variety of settings, from a race of robots with mechanical lungs to time travel in ancient baghdad.

>For most of history, the proposition that we draw life from air was so obvious that there was no need to assert it. Every day we consume two lungs heavy with air; every day we remove the empty ones from our chest and replace them with full ones. If a person is careless and lets his air level run too low, he feels the heaviness of his limbs and the growing need for replenishment. It is exceedingly rare that a person is unable to get at least one replacement lung before his installed pair runs empty; on those unfortunate occasions where this has happened—when a person is trapped and unable to move, with no one nearby to assist him—he dies within seconds of his air running out.
But in the normal course of life, our need for air is far from our thoughts, and indeed many would say that satisfying that need is the least important part of going to the filling stations. For the filling stations are the primary venue for social conversation, the places from which we draw emotional sustenance as well as physical. We all keep spare sets of full lungs in our homes, but when one is alone, the act of opening one’s chest and replacing one’s lungs can seem little better than a chore. In the company of others, however, it becomes a communal activity, a shared pleasure.

## Shogun

![shogun.jpg](/assets/shogun_1672634122828_0.jpg)

An English boat captain is stranded in the 1600s Edo period in japan and gets embroiled in an epic battle for the shogunate among the Japanese feudal lords. Extremely loosely based on a real sailor who managed commerce for the real-life Tokugawa shogunate.

>The young man was ten paces away. He wore breeches and clogs and a light kimono and two scabbarded swords were stuck into his belt. One was daggerlike. The other, a two-handed killing sword, was long and slightly curved. His right hand was casually on the hilt.

> Onushi ittai doko kara kitanoda? Doko no kuni no monoda?
The priest said nervously, “Kasigi Omi-san says, ‘Where do you come from and what’s your nationality?’ ”
“Is Mr. Omi-san the *daimyo*?” Blackthorne asked, afraid of the swords in spite of himself.
“No. He’s a samurai, the samurai in charge of the village. His surname’s Kasigi, Omi’s his given name. Here they always put their surnames first. ‘San’ means ‘honorable,’ and you add it to all names as a politeness. 
You’d better learn to be polite—and find some manners quickly. Here they don’t tolerate lack of manners.

## Minority report

![minority.jpeg](/assets/minority_1672634296433_0.jpeg)

In the future, the government invents a way to predict crime before it happens, and start arresting future criminals for the crime they're about to commit. The head of the precrime unit discovers he's about to be accused of precrime, and goes on the run. The book is completely different than the movie.

> "With the aid of your precog mutants, you’ve successfully abolished the post-crime punitive system of jails and fines. As we all realize, punishment was never much of a deterrent, and could scarcely comforted a victim already dead”

> "You’ve probably grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We’re taking in individuals who have broken no law.”
“But they surely will”
“Happily they don’t - because we get them first, before they can commit an act of violence.”

> "Precrime has cut down felonies by ninety-nine and decimal point eight percent. We seldom get actual murder or treason. After all, the culprit knows we’ll confine him in the detention camp a week before he gets a chance to commit the crime."

> "In our society we have no major crimes but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals."
We claim they’re culpable. They, on the other hand, eternally claim they’re innocent. And, in a sense, they are innocent."

## The little prince

![little-prince.jpg](/assets/little-prince_1672634527260_0.jpg)

A short children's book about a young prince visiting varios planets and discovering the meaning of love and friendship. It encourages being open minded, exploring, and maintaing your childlike sense of wonder.

>What does that mean—‘tame’?”
“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. “It means to establish ties.”
“’To establish ties’?”
“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more
than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little
boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no
need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred
thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each
other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall
be unique in all the world...”

## Saga

![saga.jpeg](/assets/saga_1672635052100_0.jpeg)

A science fiction graphic novel about a never ending war betwen two species on different planets. Two members of the opposing faction fall in love and try to survive while protecting their newborn daughter

Amazing artwork, incredibly creative and imaginative characters and settings, and very sexual.
