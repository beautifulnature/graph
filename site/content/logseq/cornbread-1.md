# Ingredients

1/2 cup (113g) butter

1/2 bunch fresh sage

1/2 bunch fresh thyme

1.25 cup (185g) all-purpose flour

1/3 cup (70g) sugar

3.5 Tbsp (50g )light brown sugar

1.25 tsp (6g) fine sea salt

1 Tbsp (13g) baking powder

1.25 cup (175g) yellow cornmeal (I think finer grind will be better)

2 eggs

1.5 cup (350ml) buttermilk

# Directions


Start by placing a cast iron pan into a cold oven and begin preheating to 400F.

In a small pot, add and melt the butter over medium heat.

Once the butter has browned, add in fresh sage and thyme. Stir around then place into a container and set to the side.

In a medium-size bowl, add and whisk together all the dry ingredients.

In a separate bowl, combine and whisk together the eggs then whisk in the buttermilk.

Remove the herbs from the browned butter and slowly whisk in the butter into the buttermilk mixture.

Whisk wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until well combined.

Remove the pan from the oven, spray with oil, and add in the batter spreading out evenly to the walls of the pan.

Place back into the oven for 20-25 minutes.

Remove and let cool for a few minutes before removing from the pan and placing onto a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
