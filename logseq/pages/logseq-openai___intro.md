- I created an AI text generation plugin for the Logseq note-taking application based on OpenAI's GPT-3. The goal is to create a free open source tool that helps people leverage powerful AI technology for their research, learning, writing, productivity, and note-taking.
- GPT-3 is an AI technology capable of generating human-like text and performing a wide variety of language tasks. The user can ask the AI to perform a task using plain English, such as "Write a blog post explaining GPT-3"
- ## Why Logseq is good for AI text generation
	- Logseq is an open source note-taking application that supports plugins, similar to VSCode.
	- Unlike most text editors, Logseq is "block", meaning it uses "blocks" of content to create a document. Each paragraph of text, each image, video or other inserted media are placed into their own "block" of space in the editor. This makes it easier to rearrange content and to add other content between existing blocks.
	- This is in contrast to a regular editor which typically just uses one large block of text for the entire document.
	- These blocks can be indented to create an information hierarchy.
	- Logseq supports a number of advanced features such as backlinks, block references, page embeds, and backlinks.
	- Block based editors also allow you to "target" individual blocks or groups of blocks for AI commands, so you can be very precise in selecting text to be used for generation, and where the generated text should be inserted.
	- These block based editors open up powerful possibilities for AI assisted text generation because they contain more more context and richer information about relationships between data.

	- So what makes the Block Editor different from a regular editor or word processor? The key difference is that each paragraph of text, each list, and each image, gallery, video or other inserted media are placed into their own 'block' of space in the editor
	  Explain what a block based editor is.
	  A Block Editor
		- baseditor is an editor that uses blocks of content to create a document. This is in contrast to a regular editor which typically just uses one large block of text for the entire document. Each paragraph, list, image, and other piece of content is placed into its own block in the editor. This makes it easier to rearrange content and to add other content between existing blocks.

	  collapsed:: true
		- I wanted to make the plugin for LogSeq so that users could take advantage of the powerful AI capabilities of GPT-3 in their daily work. The plugin allows users to generate human-like text within the LogSeq editor, which can be used to create more natural and realistic dialogue.
		- through my clinical case summary."
		  
		  As a clinical doctor, I am often asked to provide summaries of cases I have treated. These summaries are used by other doctors to help them understand the course of treatment I took and the rationale behind my decisions. They are also used to educate medical students.
		  
		  I created the LogSeq plugin-gpt3-openai so that I could generate these summaries automatically, using the GPT-3 algorithm. This algorithm is trained on a large corpus of texts, and is able to generate human-like text.
		  
		  The plugin-gpt3-openai allows me to input the relevant information about a case, and then generates a summary. This summary can then be edited by me, or by other users, to ensure that it is accurate and free of any errors.
		  
		  The advantage of using the LogSeq plugin-gpt3-openai is that it saves me a considerable amount of time, and ensures that the summaries are of a high quality.
		- I made the plugin because I think it can be really helpful for people to use powerful AI tools to aid their daily work routine. The plugin allows LogSeq users to generate human-like text using GPT-3, which can be extremely helpful in terms of writing reports or memos, for example.
		- I made the plugin because I think that GPT-3 has the potential to be a very powerful tool for generating human-like text. I think that it could be a valuable tool for people who need to generate text for their work, such as writers, bloggers, or even students who need to write essays.
