	- OK, so far, not much.
	  
	  Musk is getting stretched rather thin. Space-X seems to be doing OK with Gwynne Shotwell running things. Tesla, which Musk apparently does really run personally, is doing OK, but their side ventures are not. Self-driving is a mess. Solar panels (yes, Tesla has a solar panel business) are not doing well. The Cybertruck is years late. (Maybe next year.[1]) So is the Tesla Model 2, the low-end vehicle.
	  
	  There's still no low-cost Tesla. The market for high-end cars is somewhat saturated. Tesla's order backlog is now 78 days, much less than usual for Tesla and about typical for the auto industry. Remember, Tesla has to become bigger than Toyota to justify the stock price. It is not possible to do that at Tesla's current price points. There are not enough buyers with that much money.
	  
	  So Tesla has to compete on price with the Chevy Bolt, the Nissan Leaf, etc. Electric compact sedans are a crowded sector. Solving that problem is Musk's job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggg0dgd2cqnyvya6bqsj3jet))
