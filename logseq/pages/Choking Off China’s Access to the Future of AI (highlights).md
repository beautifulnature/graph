- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 20th, 2023]]
	- The most important chokepoints in the context of this discussion are AI chip designs, electronic design automation software, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and equipment components ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgamrypqh7m43w348et4bv))
	- In short, the Biden administration is trying to (1) strangle the Chinese AI industry by choking off access to high-end AI chips; (2) block China from designing AI chips domestically by choking off China’s access to U.S.-made chip design software; (3) block China from manufacturing advanced chips by choking off access to U.S.-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and (4) block China from domestically producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment by choking off access to U.S.-built components.

	- China is a global leader in AI research, AI commercialization, and AI-enabled military technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgbr65dnprv9tmv7qnwxea))
	- National University of Defense Technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgcgqhyxzb69g2mkr1ty5c))
	- High-end AI chips can no longer be sold to any entity operating in China, whether that is the Chinese military, a Chinese tech company, or even a U.S. company operating a data center in China ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgnv62h6kk2m7pyffsbeqq))
	- The performance threshold requires two conditions to be met. The chip must be both a very powerful parallel processor (300 tera operations per second or higher) and have a very fast interconnect speed (600 gigabytes per second or higher) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgne8e9actkaxrm4xk9mrs))
	- The strength of the combined offering of CUDA software and Nvidia hardware goes a long way toward explaining why Nvidia accounts for [95 percent](https://www.yahoo.com/now/us-deals-heavy-blow-china-100727058.html) of AI chip sales in China, according to Fubon Securities Investment Services estimates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgr1vmjzre1x9tswt6zxsn))
	- The software that enables chip designers to create the astonishingly complicated blueprints for such chips is called electronic design automation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgrntfv96kpgwm9jxchb32))
	- In the case of semiconductor EDA, there are three leading companies in the market: Mentor Graphics, Cadence Design Systems, and Synopsys ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgrw4p275xepcqhnrx2n1p))
	- in the event that Chinese companies continue to use U.S.-designed software that was either illegally pirated or legally purchased before the ban went into effect, Chinese chip designers will be unable to have their chip designs manufactured outside of China ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgvfky1xzq6kf6ayn4r8w0))
	- By invoking the foreign-direct product rule, the United States is prohibiting any semiconductor manufacturing company worldwide from providing services to any Chinese chip design company that is seeking to make high-end chips for AI or supercomputing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgvv7dygaf5qb3wqwxkkpd))
	- The foreign-direct product rule offers two hooks to block Chinese chip design companies from having their chips manufactured: on the EDA software and again on the U.S.-built equipment that is an irreplaceable (at least for now) part of every semiconductor manufacturing operation anywhere in the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgw45rgq54m0c45e10xzzw))
	- Any chip manufacturing operation—whether Chinese or otherwise—that seeks to build Chinese chip designs will risk losing its own access to U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffgz7pemskqdhytykfs68hj))
	- Block China from manufacturing advanced chips by choking off access to U.S.-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh1mwgdy60p894e4m8jser))
	- there is no advanced semiconductor fabrication facility in the world that is not critically dependent upon U.S. technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh1zczapckvdmqf7mktjn3))
	- For logic chips, China will now face licensing requirements with a presumption of denial for any fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) logic manufacturing equipment. In practice this affects nearly all logic chips being produced at the 16 nanometer (nm) or lower (better) technology nodes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh2v5yrqkr4ekf3ewag9e8))
	- S. chipmaker Intel [first began](https://www.cpu-world.com/news_2014/2014090701_Intel_launches_first_Broadwell_processors.html) mass-producing 14 nm processors in 2014, but the most advanced Chinese logic chip manufacturer, SMIC, only achieved 14 nm FinFET volume production in [late 2019](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15105/smic-begins-volume-production-of-14-nm-finfet-chips-chinas-first-finfet-line) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh33n7dw4ctef29w4qnnmz))
	- Gate-All-Around Field Effect Transistor (GAAFET), China will also face broad restrictions on purchasing of U.S. manufacturing equipment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh3vkxay0t5eyfeat7trp8))
	- For DRAM, the equipment sale restrictions will apply at the 18 nm process node and more advanced (a lower nm number ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh4193t58bcv4508amr98y))
	- Designing and building the equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is among the most technologically complex, expensive, and difficult undertakings that occur anywhere in the global economy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh4zmc6v5dd3b7060vy563))
	- Without U.S. components, China’s efforts to develop a domestic semiconductor equipment industry would be starting from scratch and attempting to replicate the cumulative achievements of the U.S. semiconductor industry over the past seven decades. It is an extremely tall mountain to climb. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh5mkcv6vrz64289zp835t))
	- In summary, the United States does not want China to have advanced AI computing and supercomputing facilities, so it has blocked them from purchasing the best AI chips, which are all American ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh5xe0tpcg2pdqs4d7dwnp))
	- It does not want China designing its own AI chips, so it has blocked China from using the best chip design software (which is all American) to design high-end chips, and it has blocked chip manufacturing facilities worldwide from accepting entity-listed Chinese chip design firms (as well as any Chinese chip company building high-end chips) as customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh646nyyzjsneb418ws1w6))
	- Finally, the United States does not want China to have its own advanced chip manufacturing facilities, so it has blocked them from purchasing the necessary equipment, much of which is irreplaceably American. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gffh6cw3zn7cqfytnxe2ey7e))
