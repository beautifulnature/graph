- write a page asking for donations to support my technical writing an open source projects
- Hello everyone!
  
  I am a technical writer and open source developer. I work on projects that help people use technology more effectively. I also write about my work on my blog and give talks at conferences.
  
  I rely on donations to keep doing this work. If you find my work helpful, please consider making a donation. Whatever you can give is deeply appreciated.
  
  Thank you so much for your support!
