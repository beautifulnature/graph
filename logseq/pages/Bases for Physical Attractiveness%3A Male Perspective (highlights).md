	- Bases for female physical attractiveness
	  General Symmetry: low fluctuating asymmetry (applies to males also)
	  Body form Waist to hip ratio of approximately 0.7 (?)
	  Face Average (applies to males also) small lower jaw (nasion to chin) high upper and lower lips small mouth (width) large eyes light skin homogenous skin texture ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z3j306f2mwd0ewhf4jen6))
	- Physical development and symmetry are regulated by:
	  growth rates hormone levels nutrition disease The level of symmetry is a measure of developmental stability. Developmental stability is an indication of an individual's ability to withstand genetic and environmental stress during growth. High FA is associated with increased morbidity and decreased heterozygosity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z4bq6peht1rt5kqtvvqhk))
	- Symmetry is positively associated with
	  ► Stature  Tall males less asymmetrical (positive association)  Small females less asymmetrical (negative association)
	  ►IQ ►Number of lifetime partners and RS (males & females)
	  ► Disease resistance ►Running speed ► Aggression ► Depression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z4keq935b3nm71e2xdaq6))
	- Averageness is associated with
	  high levels of heterozygosity which, in turn, is associated with enhanced pathogen resistance. That is, average looking people tend to be healthier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z5etjc3axyya1q483bmvn))
	- eminine and Masc ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z66gwcx4w4e8rbppp9jb3))
	- ►Males favor women with feminine faces  Small chin and high cheek bones  Fuller and more peaked lips  Large eyes (relative to face)
	  ►Females seem to favor males who are slightly to moderately facially masculine but
	  note extremely so  Chins broader and longer  Large brow ridge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z6pq7sp9n3ptqyxp6w2x9))
	- WHR is a reliable index of age, hormonal status, parity, fecundity, and health. Before puberty boys and girls have similar ratios. However, with females pelvis widens and fat is deposited on hips and thighs at puberty. Healthy women have ratios of 0.67 to 0.80 while healthy men have 0.80 to 0.95. For attractiveness, ideal for men is 0.90 and female ideal is 0.7 (for Western populations only). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z710tjbytbzs4s238x3mp))
	- WHR increases with each pregnancy and increases slightly with age. However, a 17 year old will have nearly the same WHR as a 22 year woman and at menopause it reaches the level of a male's WHR (about 1). High WHR is strongly negatively associated with the probability of conception and positively associated with age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z7x50gnxgtzxwd1jpd62t))
	- WHR ratio and health correlates
	  High WHR in women is a sign of:
	  • menstrual irregularity • Hirsutism (abnormal growth & distribution of hair)
	  • elevated plasma triglycerides • diabetes and insulin intolerance • hypertension •stroke • gall bladder disease • reproductive cancers (endometrial, ovarian, and breast) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z89ennkqrvmkvb4zv4tna))
	- WHR and Behavioral Correlates in Women
	  ►Positively correlated with age of first intercourse.
	  ►Negatively correlated with number of lifetime sexual partners and EPC’s, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z8pg0hmjb0m4r6nc85hc4))
	- WHR of 0.7 a reflection of Western standards?
	  ► Recent research by anthropologists reveals that a WHR ratio of about 0.8 is preferred in the following ethnic
	  groups:  Hadza  Shuar  Machiguenga
	  ► This is greater than the 0.7 ratio reported in the west. ► May be a consequence of living in a food short and/or high pathogen environment which suggests that men are concerned with energy status when it is relevant (i.e., not relevant in the West but relevant in tribal populations)
	  ► What about BMI? Additional research in the West suggests that BMI is more important than WHR. The
	  problem with BMI and WHR is that they are strongly correlated with each other. Therefore it is difficult to determine which is the factor that influences perceptions of attractiveness in human body form. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6z9env75a247k5vegmvvcr))
	- A final male attribute
	  SHR: shoulder to hip ratio an introduction to a male sign of fitness
	  ►Measurement:  hip measured as largest circumference around the hips and buttocks.
	   shoulder measured as greatest width of should blades with arms at sides.
	  ►Results:  men ranged from 1.03 - 1.40, mean of 1.18  women ranged from 0.9 - 1.22, mean of 1.03
	  SHR 1 of 2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6zak3mkssgnvz05q4rk690))
	- SHR in men: behavioral correlates
	  ►Negatively correlated with age at first sexual intercourse (narrow shoulders=later first sex)
	  ►Positively correlated with:  reported number of sexual partners  EPC (extra pair copulations) or cheating on your own partner (broad shoulders=more infidelity)  Attractiveness ratings by women ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6zatjwt2pz37qsgms059vh))
	- Height and Attractiveness
	  ►In the west males prefer females who are shorter than average while females prefer males who are taller than average.
	  ►Correspondingly, tall men have higher RS than shorter males and shorter females have higher RS than taller females.
	  ►In rural Gambia this relationship seems not to hold.  Tall women had higher fertility & higher survivorship of their children
	   While taller men were only very slightly more likely to have higher RS than shorter men

	- Assortative or relative models: “Like seeking like”
	  ► People marry those who resemble themselves ► Known as positive assortative mating ► Couples correlate or resemble each other for most traits (height, weight, personality, social attributes, hair color, etc.)
	  ► Presumably, this optimizes outbreeding to avoid excessive genetic variance that would interfere with coadaptive gene complexes
	  ► You can’t always get what you want: while people who have greater symmetry, etc are more attractive, people tend to marry those who are physically most like them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6zbtq7kxcqbga4cv303vpf))
	- Conclusion
	  ►There are universal standards of beauty which include:  Symmetry, WHR (or perhaps BMI), averageness, SHR, etc
	   These are measures of health and other factors associated with fitness
	   They also may vary with environmental factors (e.g., BMI preferences in Zulus and Brits)
	  ►At the same time like tend to marry like (positive assortative mating)
	  ►Both factors affect human mate choice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6zcaj8eeksnnad2kf30pds))
