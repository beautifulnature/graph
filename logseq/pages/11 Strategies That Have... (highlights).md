	- 11 strategies that have helped me write 13 books in 10 years: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012306015010816))
	- 1/ Live an interesting life
	  
	  When I was starting out, an author told me: If you want to be a great writer, go live an interesting life.
	  
	  Writing is ultimately about communicating part of the human experience.
	  
	  That means you need to go out and have human experiences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012308535791619))
	- 2/ Read. Read. Read.
	  
	  A book is made of books.
	  
	  “The greatest part of a writer’s time is spent in reading; a man will turn over half a library to make one book,” Samuel Johnson said.
	  
	  I read 300+ books to write one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012310628655106))
	- 3/ Follow the process
	  
	  At a low point during my last book, I was despairing of the book ever coming together. Then I found a note card I’d written to myself that said,
	  
	  "Keep doing your notecards...The book will come together."
	  
	  The process always gets you there…if you trust it.

	- 4/ Make commitments
	  
	  I turn in a book proposal for my next book before my latest one releases. When I get first-week sales numbers, I’m too busy writing to let them go to my head…or get me down.
	  
	  And with a deadline to meet, Resistance doesn’t have the time or space to creep in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012316765011970))
	- 5/ Make a little progress each day
	  
	  One of the best rules I’ve heard as a writer: “two crappy pages a day.”
	  
	  It’s by carving out a small win every day that a book is made.
	  
	  Hemingway said, “the first draft of anything is shit.” I keep this print in my office:

	- 6/ Talk it out
	  
	  When I get stuck, I talk the ideas through with someone I trust.
	  
	  As @ThisIsSethsBlog observed, “no one ever gets talker’s block.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012328072843264))
	- 7/ Crystallize the idea
	  
	  One of the best pieces of writing advice I ever got: articulate the book in one page then one paragraph then one sentence.
	  
	  This crystallizes the idea for you and guides you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012330333577217))
	- 8/ Stop on the “wet edge”
	  
	  Hemingway advised Thomas Wolfe “to break off work when you ‘are going good.’—Then you can rest easily and on the next day easily resume.”
	  
	  @briankoppelman has referred to this as stopping on the “wet edge.” It staves off the despair the next day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012332497846272))
	- 9/ Work with great people
	  
	  Success requires greater investment in the creative process.
	  
	  Pay for professional help.
	  
	  There’s that saying: if you think pros are expensive, try hiring an amateur. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012334657814529))
	- 10/ Put up reminders
	  
	  I forget where I stole the idea, but I'm a big proponent of printing and putting a couple of important quotes up on the wall where you work.
	  
	  I've put up quotes to help guide me generally or to inspire the style and ethos of a specific book.

	- 11/ Use everything that happens to you
	  
	  @RobertGreene once told me, "It's all material."
	  
	  It's all fuel. Everything that happens in your life, good and bad, can be material for your writing.
	  
	  Write about what you know and feel and experience. Write what only you can write. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1573012348406751242))
	- And of course, it's taken discipline to write 13 books in 10 years.
	  
	  Discipline—the topic of my latest book!—is predictive & deterministic. It predicts that you will be great AND it makes whatever you are doing great.
