	- Start with writing.
	  1a. Fewer words are more powerful than many. Attempt to reduce your word count as much as possible.
	  1b. Expand your vocabulary.
	  1c. Make your statements active, not passive (reduce or eliminate 'be' verbs).
	  1d. Plan your thoughts well and orderly.
	  1e. As much as possible write in a narrative style.
	  1f. Speak from facts. Clearly state when your opinions are your opinions. Leave nothing to chance. Nobody will assume your expertise and generally nobody cares.
	  1g. In all things execute with precise.
	  2. Speak like slow, clear, deliberation like your mastery of writing.
	  2a. Speaking is plumbing. The words that escape your mouth are sewage. You don't them back and you don't want to. Keep a solid rhythm so the plumbing does not back up.
	  2b. Speak from empathy.
	  2c. 90% of communication is non-verbal comprising tone, facial expression, and body language. Embrace this.
	  2d. Make all communications flow from logic, but remember all communications are emotional all the time.
	- Identify elements of good/bad communication patterns: https://consilienceproject.org/endgames-of-bad-communication...
	  Non-violent communication is a very structured approach to guiding people through perceived difficult behaviour: https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/2019/03/06/Want-to-impr...
	  Gain a little understanding about the give and take of communication: https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/good-conversation...
	  If possible, try to spend more time with people who espouse these desired characteristics and less time with those who don't.
	  Finally, conversation should be...fun...if possible. If you hack your way to being 100% in control of things all the time, then how much fun is that going to be for others?
	- Depending on what medium you want to communicate, there are a number of options.
	  1) the hardest to change is talking. You tend to run at the limit of your capacity, taking shortcuts to speed up. This leaves little time for planning or introspection. However that's not to say its impossible. My first step would be to "develop" empathy.
	  What I mean by empathy is understanding how people feel, not feeling how they feel. there is no need to project their feelings onto you. To do this you need to be around other people. You need to listen in to their conversations and work out what each side is feeling, and figure out what their reaction would be to the words are being said.
	  Long in person meetings are good practice, You are allowed to stare vacantly, and listen intently.
	  2) For written communication, you are running at your own speed. Look at the blurb that comes with high end advertising, try and pull apart the facts from the spin. Those words have been chosen to illicit a specific emotion.
	  As a practice, try writing a complaint, instruction, or direction that fits into one paragraph. write the same thing three time, but targeting different emotions you want to get across, something simple, like joy, respectful annoyance, disappointment. put them asside for a week, come back and see how they make you feel.
	  Iterate and improve.

	  You can see here what I think is the wrong way
	  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33090580
	  The right way, in my opinion, is to hang around with real people who you genuinely respect and admire. Do this for even a few weeks and you begin to absorb not only their mannerisms, tone, prosody and pace, but some of their more subtle speech devices.
	  If communicative kindness can be captured in any theoretical way it is probably by Jurgen Habermas's idea of communicative rationality [1].
	  The centrepiece is sincerity
	  > don't say anything that sounds demeaning or hurtful to the listener.
	  You cannot fully control that and shouldn't optimise for it. Especially is you choose to speak truthfully rather than tactically. People will infer what is not implied, and some will do so deliberately as an argumentative device to feign 'offence'.
	  The trick is to be in touch with genuine compassion and attend to the wounds you cause when speaking well.
	  > It also includes listening attentively to what the other person is saying.
	  That is the hardest skill of all in my experience. You can "listen" on many levels. If there's a trick to that it's not splitting and allowing your mind to start preparing a counter/response before the other person has finished. Eye contact and physical proximity really help.
	  Interesting fact: the word "conspiracy" comes from personal intimacy. To co-n-spire is to breath the same air as others - ie conspirators would have to be in the same room in close proximity (presumably whispering)

	- sounds demeaning or hurtful to the listener.
	  I'm guilty of all that at times. What works for me:

	  (disclosure: author of the note. I've been managing large software engineering teams for a long time and I think the investment in improving communication skills pays off incredible dividends for the both the individual and their team mates)
	- I have captured my personal experience of struggling with this topic during my career into a book called "Communication for Engineers". The book builds a foundation and then explores the myriad of ways we communicate as engineers. Lots of overviews and tips to try out. You may like it: https://chrislaffra.com/c4e

	  I'd recommend Circling. It's a practice where people talk together about what they can notice about the present moment for a set time. It has had a huge impact for me on my ability to understand and feel my own emotions and others' emotions, and how to communicate more skillfully, both professionally and privately. The practice gives you lots of experiences of skilled facilitators' use of language, as well as direct feedback on how your communication is received.
	  There's Circling Anywhere based in Texas or Circling Europe based in Amsterdam. Both offer online stuff as well as in person stuff. There are also lots of local facilitators all over the world.
