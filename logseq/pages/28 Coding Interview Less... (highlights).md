	- 28 coding interview lessons I know now, that I wish I knew 5 years ago:
	  
	  1. You only get better by solving more programming problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796859314634752))
	- 2. Pick only ONE programming language you are extremely familiar with.
	  
	  3. Biggest mistake you can make is ignoring the fundamentals.
	  
	  4. Learn and practice topics in order of importance. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796867196157952))
	- 5. Prioritize practicing most popular and frequently asked interview questions.
	  
	  6. Look for key patterns that help you solve multiple problems.
	  
	  7. Revising questions is underrated. That’s how you really internalize topics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796869859508224))
	- 8. Gather maximum detail about the interview beforehand.
	  
	  9. Understanding the problem is the primary step of problem solving.
	  
	  10. Clarify the question even if it’s clear to you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796872464207872))
	- 11. Come up with more examples to test your understanding.
	  
	  12. Break down complex questions into small independent questions.
	  
	  13. Think of multiple solutions before committing to one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796880487567361))
	- 14. It’s ok to take notes during the interview.
	  
	  15. Whenever stuck, start with a brute force solution.
	  
	  16. Explain the solution approach before writing code. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796882975125505))
	- 17. Solution first. Optimization later.
	  
	  18. Let your interviewer know before optimizing the solution.
	  
	  19. Prioritize optimizing repeated, overlapping or redundant computation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796890096705537))
	- 20. For complex algorithms, write pseudo code first.
	  
	  21. Explain your thought process while writing code.
	  
	  22. Your solution is as good as how well you communicate it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796892953034752))
	- 23. Step through the code like a debugger to catch bugs.
	  
	  24. Show your code works by testing it with sample inputs.
	  
	  25. Discuss how your provided solution can be improved. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796900687323136))
	- 26. Prepare well for self introduction and final questions.
	  
	  27. Mock interviews are a great way to make gaps in your preparation visible.
	  
	  28. Irrespective of the result, reflect on your interview experience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/codewithvoid/status/1583796903015501824))
	- That's a wrap!
