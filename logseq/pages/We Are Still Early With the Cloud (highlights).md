- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 20th, 2023]]
	- In some sort of theoretical abstract platonic form type thing, the cloud should offer us
	  
	  •   Infinite scalability
	  •   Less time spent on infrastructure
	  •   Fewer constraints
	  •   Lower costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3eq9045fj1qhx5yg9zzyj))
	- When I compile code, I want to fire up 1000 serverless container and compile tiny parts of my code in parallel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3f30n0pkr4bbzt17qvpb8))
	- When I run tests, I want to parallelize all of them. Or define a grid with a 1000 combinations of parameters, or whatever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3f51eh3ne2hdaa6t3x0ww))
	- I never ever again want to think about IP rules. I want to tell the cloud to connect service A and B! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3f5zt3th87fd7rekcqe9g))
	- Why is Bob in the ops team sending the engineers a bunch of shell commands they need to run to update their dev environment to support the latest Frobnicator version? For the third time this month? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3f97exspezh9e96d1fw9s))
	- Why do I need to SSH into a CI runner to debug some test failure that I can't repro locally? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3fb9j1tt652m5bxhk8kyq))

	- The first shift is trying to put the old stuff into the new thing. This is the “lift and shift” or “adapter” type approach. These things take advantage of the new tech to some extent, but only partially, and are stuck with legacy technology. The second shift involves products that are native to the new technology, but look like “toys”. Maybe there's no obvious business model, or the tool solves just one particular use case. But it gives some conceptual insight into what's coming. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3gxmktsthw81w0aa89y4p))
	- The exciting thing happens when the toys evolve into something that is obviously better than the legacy technology, and also better than the adapters. Online streaming services basically represents a third and final shift: take the toys but turn it mainstream. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3h5ta34vbcadayvmdp38f))
	- Our stacks are based on 50 years of technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3j532tfn737vr9wxn0ar2))
	- Do we need IP addresses, CIDR blocks, and NATs, or can we focus on which services have access to what resources? Do we need to reserve resources advance (like having a cluster of n workers, each having x GB of RAM), or can we let the runtime expand/shrink in a split second? You can probably guess which option I would put my money on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3jhwfvzy1307zgt8985yw))
