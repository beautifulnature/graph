USA nukes delivery will largely countered by S500 and possibily rumoured S600. Also, vast majority of satelites will be taken out as well (Russia and Cbina have been developing these for the past decade). In summary a small percentage of Russia survive while USA enters book of myth. The winner will largely be the Chinese and Indian. Japan and South Korea likely will be destroyed for most part of it (due to NK and lack of energy). Europe will be mostly destroyed depending on how they respond. Russia has estimated 10-20K nukes and neutron bombs as well. While entirety of Europe nukes are just under a thousand or two at best with terrible missiles defence. The only solution is to let Ukraine under the bus and remove current USA admins by any means necessary - humane or not.
