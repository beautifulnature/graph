	- Things I know now that I wish I knew at 20: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795538035146754))
	- Everything you say yes to is saying no to something else:
	  
	  Taking the meeting means saying no to an hour of reading.
	  
	  Scrolling mindlessly late at night means saying no to a productive morning.
	  
	  The Zoom call means saying no to some deep work.
	  Pick your shots. Say no. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795541671587847))
	- The things you think matter...don't:
	  
	  We spend our energy—our lives—slaving away, chasing things that don’t matter.
	  
	  Fame, awards, status, money, a legacy—none of that external stuff matters.
	  
	  Only right now matters. The life you're living—that’s the only monument that counts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795544238501890))
	- Intensity is important but also a liability:
	  
	  I look back at stuff I was so worked up about back then & now think, WHAT?
	  
	  If I had to go back & give a younger version of myself one word of advice it'd be:
	  
	  “Relax”
	  
	  Practice the Stoic art of acceptance. Let things go. Be chill. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795547392634890))
	- Lengthen your timeline:
	  
	  Opening my bookstore, The Painted Porch (delayed a year by COVID) taught me that it always takes longer than you think it’s going to take.
	  
	  That’s Hofstadter’s law.
	  
	  And even when you take the law into account, you’re still surprised. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795551813431297))
	- Pay the taxes of life gladly:
	  
	  Not just from the government.
	  
	  Annoying people are a tax on being outside your house. Delays are a tax on travel. Haters are a tax on having a YouTube channel.
	  
	  There’s a tax on everything in life. You can whine. Or you can pay them gladly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795554837499906))
	- Wealth is not having to think about money very often:
	  
	  Seneca said that poverty wasn’t having too little, it was wanting more.
	  
	  He wasn’t talking about poor people. He was talking about rich people.
	  
	  Sadly, a lot of rich people choose to live very poorly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795557609934849))
	- We all carry baggage from our childhood:
	  
	  The pain we carry from our early experiences shapes decisions we make and actions we take.
	  
	  The sooner you explore this, understand it, the sooner you’ll stop repeating its patterns.
	  
	  Heal the inner child. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795560151687172))
	- There's no such thing as 'quality' time:
	  
	  Time is time.
	  
	  In fact, as Jerry Seinfeld said, garbage time — eating cereal together late at night, laying around on the couch — is actually the best time.
	  
	  Forget chasing HUGE experiences.
	  
	  It’s all wonderful, if you so choose. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795562756370433))
	- Stop powering through crap:
	  
	  There are many books I regret powering through, none that I regret quitting.
	  
	  Life is too short to put up with bad writing—bad anything.
	  
	  If the food sucks, stop eating it.
	  
	  If the speaker is boring, get up and go.
	  
	  If the party is no fun, leave. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795565369393153))
	- Keep the main thing the main thing:
	  
	  @CallieOettinger put it well:
	  
	  "You don’t have to do a lot every day, but you have to do something. Something. Every day."
	  
	  What is that something? What is your main thing?
	  
	  When you know what that is, you have power and clarity and control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795568385097730))
	- Have a philosophy:
	  
	  Pete Carroll says his turning point as a coach was realizing he was just winging it.
	  
	  So he stopped & wrote down his entire coaching philosophy.
	  
	  Now he has something to measure himself against.
	  What’s yours?
	  
	  Don’t just wing it. Focus. Live by something. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795571920932868))
	- Design your ideal day:
	  
	  Most have big goals for the future.
	  
	  I think it’s better to know what your perfect day looks like.
	  
	  Then you can ask yourself with each opportunity and choice: Is this getting me closer or further away?
	  
	  Life is too short to not live the way you want. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795574676586498))
	- It never gets easier:
	  
	  The writing line is, "Your last book won’t write your next one.”
	  
	  It’s true for all professions. You are constantly starting at zero.
	  
	  But this is great. Jerry Seinfeld joked that “your blessing in life is when you find the torture you’re comfortable with.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795577289609220))
	- Everything starts as an uncertain mess:
	  
	  At a low point writing my last book, I found a note card that I’d written to myself that said, “Do your notecards. The book will come together.”
	  
	  That’s how it goes with every project. The process will get you there…if you trust it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795579948802051))
	- Competition is for losers:
	  
	  When people compete, somebody loses.
	  
	  So BE YOU. Be the only one of you in the whole world. Do what only you can do. Run a race with yourself.
	  
	  That's the best route to success: being yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795582138224641))
	- Leave this place better than you found it.
	  
	  That's what it says on a sign by the track I run at in Austin, put there by Hollywood Henderson:
	  
	  “Leave This Place Better Than You Found It.”
	  
	  To me, that’s the meaning of life, in things big and small. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1570795584344436737))
	- That's some of what I wish I knew at 20.
