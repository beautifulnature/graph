	- Here is my competing take:
	  The biggest problem I see in developer communication is what I call the "assumed context" problem.
	  As in, you talk/write to people as if they know all about your code, except the detail being discussed. In reality, they usually have much less detailed understanding, and you're making no sense to them.
	  I'm pretty sure this is related to people "on the spectrum" often having low "theory of mind" capabilities. People without that will just assume people know what they know, and proceed to fail at communicating with those who don't.
	  It also makes it easy to think of those who don't know what is obvious to you as idiots.
	  The workaround, if you want to communicate with the idiots surrounding you, is to start conversations by fact finding. The question "so how much do you know about the flurbigator system?" can help.
