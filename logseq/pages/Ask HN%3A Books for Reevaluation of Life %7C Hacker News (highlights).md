	- Sounds like a classic existential philosophical question to me.
	  At some point in life we all end up asking ourselves "what is the meaning of life" and "who am I"?
	  In your particular situation I would look at the the "existential given" Meaning and Meaninglessness.
	  Are you Meaning Creating or Meaning Seeking?
	  There are 5 existential givens
	  1. Freedom, Responsibility and Agency 2. Death, Human Limitation and Finiteness 3. Isolation and Connectedness 4. Meaning vs Meaninglessness 5. Emotions, Experience and Embodiment
	  My own favourite existentialist philosophers are: Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre and Søren Kierkegaard.
	  My favourite existential psychotherapists are: Irvin Yalom, Emmy Van Deurzen and Rollo May.
	  Irvin D. Yalom "Love's Executioner & Other Tales of Psychotherapy" Basic Books (2012) Rollo May, "Man's Search for Himself" W. W. Norton & Company (2009) Professor Emmy van Deurzen, "Existential Counselling & Psychotherapy in Practice" Sage Publications Ltd (2002)
	- This is what religious and philosophical books are for. I don't suggest reinventing the wheel; it was invented thousands of years ago. People go on about the benefits of meditation, but many religions emerged from it, and were subsequently built on top of those foundations.
	  I don't want to promote a specific religious book, but you could look into modern interpretations of past work. Rumi's poetry is built atop Sufism, atop Islam, which is atop the Abrahamic religions. Coleman Barks does the Rumi translations that many quote, but in doing so he morphed it to something no longer Rumi. If you find something that makes you uneasy, don't follow it, or look deeper into where the inspiration comes from.
	  James P Carse is also really good at digging deep and across multiple religions. I'd recommend that as another starting point. His most popular work is Finite and Infinite Games, which is well suited for modern society.
	- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who coined the term ‘flow’, has a whole philosophy on life detailed in:
	  Flow
	  The Evolving Self
	  There’s the ‘awakening’ thing you can do, which might give a fresh perspective:
	  The Mind Illuminated - Culadasa
	  Seeing That Frees - Rob Burbea
	  Right Concentration - Leigh Brasington
	- I generally recommend Thich Nhat Hahn's book fear, for pretty much all situations, it comes in useful for most situations relating to change.
	  I like Travels Michael Crichton for discussing the ups and downs of life.
	- David Graeber's "What's the point if we can't have fun": https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-hav....
	  Graeber makes interesting points and also criticizes views that most people in tech will at least be familiar with by now, like Dawkins and Harari.

	  The Courage to be Disliked And The Courage to be Happy By Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga
	- Read some biographies.
	  If your idea of philosophy is Pirsig, try one of Plato's Socratic dialogs as a palate-cleanser. It shouldn't be toil.
	- The Magic of Thinking Big", by David J. Schwartz. It contains the secrets to getting the most out of your job and family life.
	- Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse
	- Democracy: The God That Failed by Hans-Hermann Hoppe
	  Typically read by anarchists and libertarians, I'm not recommending it to change your politics, but rather as a philosophical exercise. It does an amazing job at taking something so ingrained and obvious to us and then flipping it on its head and forcing you to use your own logical faculties to prove whether or not what you always believed is actually logically correct.
	  A paradigm shifting book regardless of your politics or philosophical belief system.
