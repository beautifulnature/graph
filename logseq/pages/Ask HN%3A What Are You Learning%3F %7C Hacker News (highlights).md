	- I’m on maternity leave now, so I’m doing a lot of one-handed learning while nursing my newborn. Specifically:
	- Critical thinking, as it applies to the practice of software development.
	  Reading/watch list:

	  I've started my own company and am about to launch our product, so I'm learning marketing.
	  I think that I've been lucky so far because most of the traction is based on the strength of the product, and that has meant that I can sit back and gather feedback and opinions without doing anything outside of asking. However it's left me in a position where I'm unsure which steps I should be taking as I get closer and closer to launching.
	  If anyone has any resources that they've found particularly helpful, I'd love to read them.

	  Same here.
	  Good book reads:
	- Currently refreshing some of my programming knowledge. Also reviewing my math skills. I tend to do each of these things periodically to refresh some of the knowledge I might not use so much anymore. Currently thinking of some side projects to work on as well.
	  On my radar for the Fall is learning a second language and beginning to learn woodworking. Speaking of that, any advice on the first tools a beginning woodworker should add to their shop?
	- Arduino programming + motor control (Stepper robots, for robotics - toy, not industrial) cobbled with 3D printing.
	  I've always been fascinated with robotics, and the barrier to entry is getting lower by the second.
	  But I want to know all the details, so I'm going slow and steady at it (Like, instead of using libraries - at least when learning - I'm coding 100% of the stepper motor control routines).
	  I plan on making my own designs, and make my own versions of known ones: The first thing I want to try my hand at is either (my own version of) a PolarGraph or an AxiDraw.
	  Then I'll move to other things, also in the early stages of designing a chess playing (arm) robot.

	  Not enough.
	  This is timed so perfectly for me to say this. Building things still is great but the amount of stack-specific knowledge I need day-to-day is skyrocketing.

	- Quantum computing via https://quantum.country/
	- CS 436: Distributed Computer Systems I started with MIT's course but realized a few pieces of the puzzle are missing in my model of the web, this course is better for noobs.

	- I'm learning about the format (sections) of executable machine code files. - I'm learning about love, e.g. how different ppl express their affections and what they expect from others they love. - I'm learning about Stoicism and Cynicism (Hellenistic philosophy). - I'm restudying nursing, so I can go back to work. - I'm trying to understand myself.
	- Reinforcement Learning :-

	  Reinforcement Learning, second edition: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton & Andrew G. Barto is like one of the, if not the, best book to learn reinforcement learning. I really enjoyed it!
