	- As far as I know, the state of crypto privacy is that everything is directly traceable except:
	  * Bitcoin lightning transactions when the lightning nodes involved are trusted to not keep logs
	  * Transactions through mixers with a lot of users
	  * Monero transactions
	  * Zcash private transactions
	  And everything is de-facto traceable except:
	  * Tornado cash users who use standard-size amounts (or users of another equivalently large smart-contract-based mixer)
	  * Monero users who are careful about their entry/exit
	  Zcash privacy doesn't have enough users for anonymity, most mixers are too small, and lightning users generally use nodes from exchanges which do log a lot of information that isn't kept on chain.
	  Am I missing anything? This seems kind of bad for cryptocurrencies in general if everything is basically traceable.
