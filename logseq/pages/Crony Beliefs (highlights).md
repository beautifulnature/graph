	- it needs to complete projects on time and under budget. And in order to do that, it needs to act like a *meritocracy*, i.e., by hiring qualified workers, monitoring their performance, and firing those who don't pull their weight ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyne9t8mp6g8s57209m3nc))
	- But at the same time, Acme also needs to appease the city council. And thus it needs to engage in a little *cronyism*, i.e., by hiring workers who happen to be well-connected to the city council (even if they're unqualified) and preventing those crony workers from being fired (even when they do shoddy work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsynhmfkpyrkp338t1tzg09))
	- contend that the best way to understand all the crazy beliefs out there — aliens, conspiracies, and all the rest — is to analyze them as *crony beliefs*. Beliefs that have been "hired" not for the legitimate purpose of accurately modeling the world, but rather for social and political kickbacks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsypv7kw01185xc4e8ww0p1))
	- People are embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that bring the belief-holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or disciples, rather than beliefs that are most likely to be true ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsypzw1m3kwpydnm7zyk14g))
	- **Meritocracy**, where we monitor beliefs for accuracy out of fear that we'll stumble by acting on a false belief; and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyq6x3j1gbv49grvs87vmj))
	- **Cronyism**, where we don't care about accuracy so much as whether our beliefs make the right impressions on others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyq8ww5jzkkcnthkscn1cy))
	- At work, we're rewarded for believing good things about the company. At church, we earn trust in exchange for faith, while facing severe sanctions for heresy. In politics, our allies support us when we toe the party line, and withdraw support when we refuse ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyrdw4ys9wg87r732s9130))
	- **Blending in**. Often it's useful to avoid drawing attention to ourselves; as Voltaire said, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong." In which case, we'll want to adopt ordinary or common beliefs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsys1wvam2jf7m87nfdw616))
	- **Sticking out**. In other situations, it might be better to bristle and hold unorthodox beliefs, in order to demonstrate that we're independent thinkers or that we don't cow to authority. This is similar to the biological strategy of [aposematism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism), and I suspect it's one of the key motives driving people to conspiracy theories and other contrarian beliefs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsys8xw3yc6n1mk3sd6wmy2))
	- **Sucking up**. Being a yes-man or –woman, or otherwise adopting beliefs that flatter those with power, is an established tactic for cozying up to authority figures. Similarly — though we don't think of it as "sucking up" — we often use beliefs to demonstrate loyalty, both to individuals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsysxb7kbm6272p520h9y0g))
	- **Showing off**, AKA signaling. We can use our beliefs to show off many of our cognitive or psychological qualities: intelligence, kindness, openness, cleverness, etc. I'm sure Elon Musk impressed a lot of people with his willingness to entertain the mind-bending idea that our universe is merely a simulation; whether he's right or wrong is largely incidental ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyt6e69vsaw5d3qs90h48b))
	- **Cheerleading**. Here the idea is to believe what you want *other people* to believe — in other words, believing your own propaganda, drinking your own Kool-aid. Over-the-top self-confidence, for example, seems dangerous as a private merit belief, but makes perfect sense as a crony belief, if expressing it inspires others to have confidence in you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsytja8j0zy5kj22wj2f1qw))
	- **Jockeying for high ground**. This might mean the moral high ground ("Effective Altruism is the only kind of altruism worth doing") or some kind of social high ground ("New York has so much more culture than San Francisco"). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsytr785wbvtvy1es3wtzdx))
	- ![](https://meltingasphalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/merit_vs_crony_beliefs.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyv70ncbfmcqxe49axnccb))
	- **Abstract and impractical**. Merit beliefs have value only insofar as we're able to make use of them for choosing actions; we need some "skin in the game ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyvsk51pvkwyyqjvq20zy4))
	- **Benefit of the doubt**. When we have social incentives to believe something, we stack the deck in its favor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyvxmggjrz73a4knemsbmx))
	- **Conspicuousness**. The whole point of a crony belief is to reap social and political rewards, but in order to get these rewards, we need to advertise the belief in question ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyw26sad69bgk9dkefn7a2))
	- **Overconfidence**. Related to the above, crony beliefs will typically provide more social value the more confident we seem in them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyw6949pfah46vxzhmver8))
	- **Reluctance to bet**. Betting on a belief is just as good as acting on it; both mechanisms create incentives for accuracy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyw98waqjq7naz0xnq7mp5))
	- the biggest hallmark of epistemic cronyism is exhibiting **strong emotions**, as when we feel *proud* of a belief, *anguish* over changing our minds, or *anger* at being challenged or criticized ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsywhqwsajcfcwk2qqpgg03))
	- *Political beliefs*, like whether gun control will save lives or which candidate will lead us to greater prosperity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyx6mqx5r6d69hc7s90xab))
	- *Religious beliefs*, like whether God approves of birth control or whether Islam is a "religion of peace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyx8wt5y8cw6a3ns5x5mqd))
	- *Ethical beliefs*, like whether animals should have legal personhood or how to answer the various [trolley problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyxe7gjybmdwy33nc73cz0))
	- *Beliefs about the self*, like "I'm a good person," or "I have free will." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyxgwwk8f3vb1z956zy6gf))
	- *Beliefs about identity groups*, like whether men and women have statistically different aptitudes or whether certain races are mistreated by police. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsyxkjt9280ydwbn15h0z38))
