	- I watched tons of videos, and joined communities related to Notion.
	  
	  I worked on my first project to build a Notion dashboard to keep track of my finances. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782735572058116))
	- Later, I came to the idea of building in public on Twitter. 
	  
	  I’ve seen many doing the same, and it’s really inspiring to see one go from idea to launch.
	  
	  I started talking about Notion and sharing my ideas on Twitter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782742110982153))
	- Secondly, I became known to the Notion community as the minimalist guy.
	  
	  My Notion pages does not have colourful icons, emojis or illustrations. 
	  
	  It was simple, clear and effective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782753095872524))
	- This made me realised that the easiest way to stand out from a crowded market is to be different.
	  
	  So don’t afraid to be different. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782755981561861))
	- One challenge with acquiring customers is building trust. 
	  
	  I don’t have any background, testimonials to back my knowledge in Notion, neither do my products.
	  
	  Thus, I started sharing my templates for free. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782758728822787))
	- With every template I build, I understood more about the software and learn to implement more effective workflows, organisations, systems and frameworks.
	  
	  This was what allowed me to put a higher pricing behind my products. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782770271555592))
	- But how did I made $12,000 in one month?
	  
	  This is because I now have multiple avenues of traffic to my products.
	  
	  Blogs, newsletters, email list, third party marketplaces and mentions across social media. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782773727653888))
	- Digital products like Notion templates are low maintenance, and can be sold an infinite times once you build it.
	  
	  This allowed me to scale up my revenue by putting myself on more platforms.
	  
	  And that is exactly what I did, and what I’m still doing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1491782776588095495))
