	- The Feynman Technique
	  
	  To learn anything:
	  
	  Step 1: Identify a topic.
	  Step 2: Try to explain it to a 5-year-old.
	  Step 3: Study to fill in knowledge gaps.
	  Step 4: Organize, convey, and review.
	  
	  True genius is the ability to simplify, not complicate.
	  
	  Simple is beautiful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969262673825800))
	- Directional Arrow of Progress
	  
	  "Study the undeniable arrows of progress." - @wolfejosh
	  
	  The future is extremely difficult to predict—but there are clues.
	  
	  Look at the trend line of progress and where it's pointing—directionally, not precisely.
	  
	  Invest (or build) accordingly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969263676264460))
	- The Eisenhower Decision Matrix
	  
	  Place all of your tasks on a 2x2 matrix of urgency and importance.
	  
	  (1) Important & Urgent
	  (2) Important & Not Urgent
	  (3) Not Important & Urgent
	  (4) Not Important & Not Urgent
	  
	  Prioritize, delegate, or delete accordingly.

	- The Regret Minimization Framework
	  
	  The goal is to minimize the number of regrets in life.
	  
	  When faced with a difficult decision:
	  (1) Project yourself into the future.
	  (2) Look back on the decision.
	  (3) Ask "Will I regret not doing this?"
	  (4) Take action. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969269128962048))
	- The @KatColeATL Pygmalion Effect
	  
	  High expectations lead to high performance (and vice versa).
	  
	  If you consistently see people as their potential, they will achieve more.
	  
	  When you're occasionally let down, consider it a tax you pay for all the benefit from those you believed in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969270131372033))
	- The @nntaleb "Look the Part" Framework
	  
	  If forced to choose between two options of seemingly equal merit, choose the one that doesn’t look the part.
	  
	  The one who doesn’t look the part has had to overcome much more to achieve its status than the one who fit in perfectly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969271104393222))
	- Decentralized Friend Groups
	  
	  Centralized Friend Group: one cluster of friends with shared backgrounds and beliefs.
	  
	  Decentralized Friend Groups: small clusters of friends unconnected to each other.
	  
	  Opting for decentralized friend groups is the key to independent thought.

	- The Seinfeld Calendar Framework
	  
	  Jerry Seinfeld would hang a huge calendar on the wall and use a red marker to put an X over every day that he completed his daily writing.
	  
	  It wasn't about the writing being good, it was about the consistency.
	  
	  Applies to more than just writing... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969278993977344))
	- Christensen's Disruptive Innovation Framework
	  
	  New innovation may take root by providing a simple solution to a segment of a market that is under or over-served by incumbents.
	  
	  Upstarts provide the exact level of product/service needed and relentlessly drive this wedge to expand. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969280034123780))
	- Skin in the Game
	  
	  Skin in the Game means that the key principals participate in both the upside and downside associated with any decisions.
	  
	  Always look for its presence in any new situation.
	  
	  Avoid games where those making the rules don't have any skin in the game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969281007235083))
	- 7 Powers
	  
	  Hamilton Helmer's "7 Powers" is a holy grail of business strategy.
	  
	  The 7 Powers are the foundation of durable value creation:
	  
	  (1) Cornered Resources
	  (2) Counter-Positioning
	  (3) Network Economies
	  (4) Scale Economies
	  (5) Switching Costs
	  (6) Branding
	  (7) Process Power ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969281967697924))

	  (4) Threat of Substitution
	  (5) Threat of New Entry

	- The Weekend Test
	  
	  "What the smartest people do on the weekend is is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years." - @cdixon
	  
	  Observe the weekend projects of the smartest people in your circles.
	  
	  Odds are those will become a key part of our future.
	  
	  Invest accordingly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969284874297345))
	- The @paulg Crazy Idea Framework
	  
	  If someone proposes a crazy idea, ask:
	  (1) Are they a domain expert?
	  (2) Do I know them to be reasonable?
	  
	  If yes on both (1) and (2), you should take the idea seriously, as it may be an asymmetric bet on the future. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969286019395584))
	- The Duck Test
	  
	  If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.
	  
	  You can determine a lot about a company or person by regularly observing its or their habitual characteristics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969287403507713))
	- Newton's Flaming Laser Sword
	  
	  If something cannot be settled by experiment or observation, it is not worth debating.
	  
	  This will save you from wasting a lot of time on pointless arguments. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969288376537099))
	- "What Will Stay the Same?" Framework
	  
	  Jeff Bezos famously said that investing in what might change is risky, but investing in what will stay the same is safe.
	  
	  The future is hard to predict, so looking for constants you can deliver against may provide a cleaner path to success. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969289307656194))
