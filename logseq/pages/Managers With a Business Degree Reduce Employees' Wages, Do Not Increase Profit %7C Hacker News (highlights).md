	- Back in the early 2000s when startups were not cool, it was much less likely to find people with business degrees working in a startup. They preferred Wall St companies and big companies in general.
	  But once startups started to seem cool we got shows like Shark Tank and Silicon Valley is full of people for whom traditional definitions of status and hierarchy are a big part of their self identity and aspirational posture. Those who would otherwise have gone to work at Goldman or Deloitte are now bringing their status-seeking worldview to startups. While not all have business degrees, many have the same kind of high achiever / status focus. They want an impressive title and they want a team under them, etc.
	  The VC world is poor at discerning the correct signals, because many such employees have impressive educational pedigrees which we all know helps to sell "the team" to the next round of investors, and they are usually pretty good at making decks, etc.
