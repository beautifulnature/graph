		- >> Five years ago, an often-cited meta-analysis from Schoenfeld et al (3) found that strength gains were augmented with high- (&gt;60% of one-repetition maximum (1RM)) versus low- (≤60% of 1RM) load training, but muscle growth was similar between training loads. Since then, more data (4, 5) seem to confirm those findings, suggesting that lifters can choose their preferred loading paradigm (high or low loads) and maximize hypertrophy.

		- >> men reported high session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scores and greater ratings of “displeasure” after low-load (25-30RM) than after high-load (8-12RM) training to failure. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#51e7d1d2-be22-43c4-a655-f6b66abf7455)
		- >> The reviewed study (1, 2) split 23 untrained women into high- (n = 12, 80% of 1RM) and low- (n = 11, 30% of 1RM) load training groups for eight weeks. Both groups performed 2-3 sets of machine-based exercises (leg extensions, seated shoulder presses, leg curls, and lat pulldowns) to failure twice per week. The researchers assessed body composition and 1RM strength on each exercise before and after the training program. Effort-based RPE was assessed after each set, and sRPE was assessed immediately after each session. Feeling scale ratings (-5 – very bad to +5 very good) and intention to exercise within the next week and next month (0% – no intention to 100% – strong intention) were assessed immediately, 15 minutes, and 60 minutes after each training session. Findings showed no significant differences between groups for strength gains, body composition changes, set RPE, sRPE, feeling scale ratings, or intention to exercise at any time point. Set RPE and sRPE scores tended to increase over time across both groups. Feeling scale ratings were positively related to intention to exercise at various points throughout the study (i.e., more pleasure related to greater intention to exercise again). These findings suggest that untrained lifters can gain strength to a similar degree with both high- and low-load training. Further, these individuals had similar perceptual and affective responses to training, suggesting that long-term training adherence may not be compromised with low-load training.

		- >> subjects perform leg extensions not to failure or to failure at 30% of 1RM for eight weeks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#64d960f6-493b-42ee-9546-7a0264d4ca79)
		- >> The researchers reported that quadriceps cross-sectional area increased by +7.7%% in the failure condition but only by 2.6% in the non-failure condition. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#32fa93e8-9ec0-4711-91ce-a64fef026f67)
		- >> untrained men bench pressing at 80% of 1RM (8 reps per set), training to failure at 40% of 1RM [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#5a2b11d6-9938-424f-ae15-e3e6ee24964e)
		- >> the 80% (+4.4mm; +14.5%) and 40% to failure (+4.9mm; +16.8%) groups tended to increase triceps muscle thickness more than the 40% not to failure group (+2.4mm; +8.1%). Therefore, based upon the findings of Lasevicius et al and Terada et al there seems to be an added benefit to low-load training when it’s performed to failure. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#799a0a0f-2f11-45a5-879b-623535638436)
		- >> In reality, there’s evidence on both sides for hypertrophy. Specifically, Schuenke et al (17) found a 25.6% and 23.4% greater increase in type I and type IIa fiber cross-sectional area, respectively, among untrained women training with 6-10RM loads than those training with 25-30RM loads. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#6ebaa229-059b-4937-a574-25a2d15157ec)
		- >> However, Franco et al (18 – MASS Review) found that untrained women gained more fat-free leg mass with 25-30 reps per set (+4.6%) than with 8-10 reps per set (+1.5%). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#e21aa5af-2111-48d0-8f6a-d9f9ad28269c)
		- >> Ikezoe et al (22) found no significant differences in quadriceps muscle thickness in healthy men after leg extension training of either 12 (sets) × 8 (reps) at 30% of 1RM versus 3 × 8 at 80% of 1RM for eight weeks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#21a8892b-0e72-426a-a0ba-97f0eaea7d91)
		- >> women and men perform circuit training for 12 weeks. Each session consisted of four rounds of five exercises. Each round consisted of one set performed for 30 seconds at either 30% or 70% of 1RM. The researchers reported that increases in lean body mass were not significantly different between groups (30%: +1.11 kg; 70%: +1.25kg). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#f1693066-7e41-4c96-9309-185833de4596)
		- >> In brief, effort-based RPE is assessed either after every set or after the entire session (e.g., sRPE) when used in resistance training. The presently reviewed study (1) used the original Borg 6-20 scale (26); however, the Borg 0-10 scale (27) is also commonly used to assess sRPE. Both scales are anchored on the low end with a descriptor of “little to no effort” and on the high end with “maximal effort.” In general, if two protocols lead to similar hypertrophy and strength outcomes, but lifters deem that one of the protocols took less effort, then the implication is that lifters will recover more quickly from the lower effort protocol and possibly increase their long-term adherence to training. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#19f2a667-92d7-48d0-86fc-29aa70319187)
		- >> the affective response was assessed via the -5 (very bad) to +5 (very good) feeling scale. Negative ratings on the scale are seen as “displeasure” while positive ratings are viewed as a “pleasurable” experience. More broadly, feeling scale responses may encompass a variety of feelings related to mood, emotion, and someone’s general psychological state (28, 29 – MASS Review). It seems intuitive that feeling scale ratings of greater pleasure (more positive) would be related to a greater intention to exercise, and they were in the presently reviewed study. However, Ekkekakis (28) indicated in a review paper that ratings of displeasure might indicate a feeling of accomplishment and pride; thus, we shouldn’t be so quick to classify negative feeling scale ratings as a sign that the lifter wouldn’t want to continue with the training program.

		- >> When comparing sRPE between high- and low-load training, some research has shown low-load training to elicit a greater sRPE (6, 30, 31), and some research has indicated high-load training to elicit a greater sRPE (32, 33, 34, 35).

		- >> Pritchett et al (30) found that 20 recreationally trained men reported a significantly higher sRPE following three sets on six exercises to failure at 60% than at 90% of 1RM. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#afab5bcc-912a-4187-9070-da19afc03d7a)
		- >> In agreement with Prichett (30), Shimano et al (31) found that both trained and untrained individuals reported higher sRPE following one set to failure at 60% of 1RM on the squat, bench press, and curl compared to one set to failure at both 80% and 90% of 1RM. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#0e4bb069-7ab7-4454-b57e-e665899530a4)
		- >> Further, Ribeiro et al (6 – MASS Review) found that trained men reported higher sRPE, greater discomfort (on a 0-10 Likert scale), and lower feeling scale ratings (more displeasure) when following three sets to failure with a 25-30RM load on the bench press, hack squat, and lat-pulldown versus three sets to failure with an 8-12RM load.

		- >> Anderson et al (1) and Dinyer et al (2) found that long-term strength and body composition changes were not different between groups of untrained women performing low-load (30% of 1RM) and high-load (80% of 1RM) training to failure. Further, this study found that the perceptual and affective responses to high and low loads were not significantly different.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/everything-there-is-to-know-about-high-load-versus-low-load-trai-18398eee3f8#9880dea9-da06-4c45-8c5c-a1328e50105a)
		- >> Researchers split untrained men into two groups. Both groups performed leg extensions, seated shoulder presses, leg curls, and lat pulldowns for eight weeks. One group performed three sets to failure at 30% of 1RM (low-load group), and the other performed three sets to failure at 80% of 1RM (high-load group).
