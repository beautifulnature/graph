	  Good clients are like good jobs, few and far between. Contracting is not the solution to bad jobs, a good job is the solution to a bad job.
	  If you can find good clients, contracting can be great, but bad clients can be a real drag: it’s easier to quit a job than it is to fire a client.
	  I’d recommend giving it a go, but don’t expect it to be better, just different. Personally, on balance, I prefer it and don’t plan to go back to full time… but it’s often just as defeating.
	  (Regarding how easy it is, it’s very easy, anybody who can get a full time job can do contracting, software engineering contracting is in high demand, always.)

	  I confirm that, I was pretty in same situation as OP contemplating going solo. I soon realized this would only make thing worst. I spend some time looking around for my dream job + dream team. I found it in another city, It is an old-ish small company (25 years, ~20 employee) got interviewed by Owner and CTO and it clicked right away between us. Quality of life is more important than growth for them. My wife was very supportive and we moved with the kids over there. Best decision of my life. My wife noticed a night and day difference in my general mood. I realize I got lucky but this is the real fix.
	- Been a contractor for about a decade now. A few tips:
	  You need at least 1.5x ideally 2x your normal rate to make it worth it.
	  You need to always be selling, probably should make sure you are consistently overbooked if you want to keep contracting sustainably. Otherwise if you focus on one client only and they go poof, you are back in line for a job.
	  Be prepared to work many many more hours because of the above.
	  Don’t forget to calculate ALL your costs.
	  If you can get a monthly retainer for X number of hours for close to your target hourly rate, take it even if it’s a little low. As long as you are good you’ll (probably) never really need to spend X hours. Leaving you with extra billable hours to devote to other clients while still having some guaranteed income. This is one of the only ways to get ahead, aside from charging “book” hours (estimates) rather than actual elapsed hours.
	  You’ll get stuck in whatever price range you start with so do not lowball yourself. Again, always be selling, and hours are precious, don’t waste them.
	  It’s a stressful life because you start to have issues taking any time off.
	- A self-employed accountant once told me that you take your hourly wage and triple it. 1/3 is your salary, 1/3 is for business expenses and taxes, 1/3 is for when you don't have work.
	  The lucrative part is when you get more than 1 FTE of work and start hiring employees. Which was my experience working for a small consulting firm. I made decent money with my 1/3 salary, but my bosses made $$$$ because we priced for 1/3 downtime but were constantly flush with work.
	  Good luck!
	- I have been an IC all my career and love writing code. I am not a hater of corporate environments, but I wanted to build something on my own for a long time. I have quit 4 months ago to work on my startup, solo.
	  I hope my experience working solo can shed light on how working solo is (If you plan to go into consulting and not build something for yourself, the experiences could be different):
	  1. Unlimited technology choices, but at the same time considering costs have to backoff from ideal choices. For example: I can't spin out a microservice for every damn small thing, consolidate so I can save on compute costs.
	  2. Working alone is hard, really hard. Try to spend time with your partner, former co-workers etc.
	  3. It not just writing code all the time. Consider the effort and costs on the corporate side of things. Incorporating, issuing stock, compliance, taxes, bookkeeping, prospective investor meetings, insurance etc. They all take time or money.
	  4. Having a partner who has a full-time job really helps. My wife works full-time and we have our health insurance figured out and have a regular stream of income to take care of our necessities.
	  5. You are always on-call and have to plan your vacations or at times skip one based on your business needs.
	  6. You have to sell. Sell to your friends, co-workers, your neighbors - anyone who you think can use your product. It's a little awkward at time, but I joke it off and try selling again.
	  7. 14-16hrs a day is pretty usual on weekdays. I don't work on Sundays and work late night on Saturdays. Support from family is pretty important.
	  8. Lastly, expect to be a generalist. Plan to work on everything - product management, UX design, frontend, backend, infrastructure, documentation, graphic work, video editing, blogging, marketing, sales calls, demos, everything you can possibly imagine to stretch your runway.
	- So…I did this and pretty much made every mistake possible.

	- I made the move to become a solo developer building my own apps in Apr 2022. Here are the steps I took:
