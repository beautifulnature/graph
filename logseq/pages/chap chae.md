	- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
	- 1 medium onion, plum sized (peeled root end removed, sliced thinly with the grain)
	- 1 medium carrot (peeled, stem removed, cut into thin matchsticks)
	- 2 large dried shiitake mushrooms (soaked in warm water for 2 to 3 hours, cut into thin strips)
	- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
	- 1/2 red bell pepper (seeded, destemmed, white pith removed, cut into thin strips)

- ## Directions
	- Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the noodles into the boiling water, cover and cook for 1 minute. Stir noodles with a wooden spoon, so they don't stick together. Cover and keep cooking for approximately 5 minutes until the noodles are soft and chewy.
	- Strain and cut them a few times witih kitchen scissors. Put the noodles into a large bowl. Add toasted sesame oil, shoyu, and sugar. Mix well by hand or a wooden spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
	- Heat up a skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, then onion, and cook for 1 minute. Add in the carrots and mushrooms and cook for an additional minute. Add in the garlic, bell pepper, and the green onion, and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes until the onion looks translucent. Transfer to the noodle bowl.
	- Add the spinach, egg, sliced bulgogi and sesame seeds. Mix it and taste. Adjust seasoning with sugar, shoyu, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Transfer it to a large plate and serve.
