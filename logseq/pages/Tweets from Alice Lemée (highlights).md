	- I've been a digital nomad for a year.
	  
	  My best advice:
	  
	  1. Invest in noise-canceling headphones.
	  2. Don't schedule work calls on travel days.
	  3. Cook. Eating out 24/7 makes you sluggish.
	  4. For each new place, listen to a new album or get a new perfume (helps make vivid memories) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alicellemee/status/1566845669394026496))
	- Wow, woke up to 20K! ü•Ç
	  
	  In celebration, doing a lil' AMA. ü§†
	  
	  Ask me about freelance writing, building a business, living creatively, or anything, really.
	  
	  Here to help however I can. ü§ù
	  
	  P.S - Getting to 20K took about 783 days of tweeting almost every day. Consistency, folks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alicellemee/status/1567226703293849600))
