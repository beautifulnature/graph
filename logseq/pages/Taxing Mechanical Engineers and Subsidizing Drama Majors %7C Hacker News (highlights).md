	- The relief policy has been terribly irresponsible:
	  * Those who sacrificed and paid off their student debt receive no reward. Those who put 10k in ink or vacations on the books get a 10K payday.
	  * People are now incentivized to not pay off the last 10K of their debt until there is an answer if relief will be enacted or not
	  * The policy smacks of "vote us back in or else 10K wont be yours"
	  In general I am strongly against policies which change the rules on and penalize people who sacrificed to better their life and better those who made relatively worse choices (or choices with known tradeoffs, but then the tradeoffs get mitigated at the expense of those who did something more taxing for a reward). You can tax the wealth out of those who chose to better their income, but you cannot tax the experiences (eg:travel) out of those who dissipated their resources today/in the past.
	  For example, bad news for those who never had a dream to be a Mech Eng, but did it anyways for the good of their family.
	  As a general observation being in America the past ~10 yrs I find America has a major problem with policies that pattern match this kind of subsidize the negative side of choices with tradeoffs to the detriment of someone else who made a sacrifice to receive a reward.
