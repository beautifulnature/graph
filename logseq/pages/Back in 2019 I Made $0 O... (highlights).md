	- 1/ Build a creator funnel
	  
	  This is a simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.
	  
	  It has 4 key parts:
	  
	  1. Discovery
	  2. Trust
	  3. Relationships
	  4. Monetization
	  
	  The first part is getting discovered. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1537409695194963968))
	- 2/ Get Discovered
	  
	  If nobody finds your thoughts/ideas, nothing else matters.
	  
	  You want to start by creating value where folks are already consuming.
	- 3/ Teach people (educate)
	  
	  The easiest way to get discovered is by teaching prospective followers & customers how to do something.
	  
	  These are "tactical" Tweets and threads that show off a bit of your expertise.
	  
	  Share your knowledge!

	- 4/ Be entertaining
	  
	  Teaching is helpful, but if you hammer your audience with teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them. 
	  
	  If you bore them, you might get tuned out. 
	  
	  This is where entertainment comes in.

	- 5/ Challenge people
	  
	  Content that challenges perceptions should get the reaction:
	  
	  "I've never thought of it like that before", or...
	  "What an interesting observation" or just...
	  "Damn."
	  
	  Open people up to a new perspective and win.

	- 6/ Empathize
	  
	  Some content reaches your audience & says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone". 
	  
	  This content draws your audience in closer & greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.

	- 7/ Learn to add value
	  
	  All of these pieces of content are intended to "add value" to the reader.
	  
	  It's a phrase that is used so often, but people rarely understand how to approach it.
	  
	  But, it's not a mystery. 
	  
	  Here's my favorite way to describe it, from @dvassallo

	- @dvassallo 8/ Build Trust
	  
	  Once you get discovered, you must build a deeper level of trust.
	  
	  Not trust in the traditional sense of the word, but trust in your expertise.
	  
	  That you actually know what you're doing & can back up what you talk about.
	  
	  This is critical.
	  
	  So how do you do that? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1537409722453737477))
	- @dvassallo 9/ Write a newsletter
	  
	  A newsletter is a great way to show your expertise.
	  
	  Long-form allows you to go deeper & more tactical in your lessons.
	  
	  You're literally showing people how your brain works.
	  
	  I do this weekly in The Saturday Solopreneur:

	- @dvassallo 10/ Start a Podcast
	  
	  If you don't want to write, start a podcast.
	  
	  It shows your expertise, and you get the side benefit of connecting w/ interesting people.
	  
	  Social proof!
	  
	  Like how @dickiebush & @nicolascole77 do it on the Ship30for30 podcast.

	- @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 12/ Learn to "deplatform"
	  
	  I started a newsletter because I wanted to "deplatform" my audience from social media to something I actually own: 
	  
	  An email address.
	  
	  I've found this is the best way to guard against the unforeseen, like algorithm changes or being banned.
	  
	  A must. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1537409732444569600))
	- @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 13/ Deepen Relationships
	  
	  Once trust is built, you can build deep relationships.
	  
	  Create a community to show a "behind-the-scenes" glimpse at how you think, act, & work.
	  
	  It's easier to invite someone in once they trust your expertise.
	  
	  Build your community of fans. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1537409734579474432))
	- @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 14/ Monetize
	  
	  With a community of fans, monetization becomes a lot easier.
	  
	  You basically have a "shopping mall". A captive audience.
	  
	  People are looking to buy and you're the store owner.
	  
	  No algorithm. No open rates. No friction.
	  
	  Here are some things you can do: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1537409736680910848))
	- @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal Well...that's a wrap.
