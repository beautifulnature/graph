	- 1/n Ontologies or classifications or hierarchies are made with a purpose in mind. What you do for collecting data or simulating behavior differs from what you do for knowledge. So anything about "data" should be a stopper. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737025823666176))
	- 3/ Ultimately, knowledge will be shared. It's always better to reuse existing schema than invent new ones. That's why @Kneaver has batteries included. A book is a book for every user. So the first move is to play collectively not everyone on his side. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737030311149570))
	- 4/ Entities (concrete palatable or virtual objects) have non-ambiguous names and are the first target for categorization: people, organizations, books etc. Low-hanging fruits. They matter but a PKM is from far not only made of entities (or you are doing it wrong) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737032324444160))
	- 5/ The less "essential" type, the better. Essential types correspond to essence of things. For everything else facets (packages of attributes) or interfaces ( packages of behaviors) are more flexible ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737034795278336))
	- 6/ Relational attributes should propagate constraints to their arguments. People have been scratching their heads to find good classes. A book author, for example, can be either a person or an organization or a mix. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737036812734465))
	- 7/ Maybe the most important. If the system don't enforce the taxonomy and don't have tools to audit and maintain the constraints, then it's doomed. It's not enough to support the creation, you must also support sustainability. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737039656099840))
	- Before you embark on a huge effort of classification, make sure you can maintain it. 
	  
	  Otherwise it will be a lot of work for little return on investment just like the focus on excessive notetaking in your prior system #JustSaying ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brunowinck/status/1583737041816522754))
