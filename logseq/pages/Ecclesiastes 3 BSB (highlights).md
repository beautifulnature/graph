	- 1To everything there is a season,  and a time for every purpose under heaven:  2a time to be born and a time to die,  a time to plant and a time to uproot,  3a time to kill and a time to heal,  a time to break down and a time to build,  4a time to weep and a time to laugh,  a time to mourn and a time to dance,  5a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together,  a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,  6a time to search and a time to count as lost,  a time to keep and a time to discard,  7a time to tear and a time to mend,  a time to be silent and a time to speak,  8a time to love and a time to hate,  a time for war and a time for peace.
