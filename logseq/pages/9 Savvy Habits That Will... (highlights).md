- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 20th, 2023]]
	- 1. Make People Feel Important (SHR Method)
	  
	  Your formula to be charismatic:
	  
	  Seen
	  • Give eye contact
	  • Offer a specific compliment
	  
	  Heard
	  • Ask good questions
	  • Be interested, not interesting
	  
	  Remembered
	  • Follow up
	  • Remember name(s)
	  • Recall something you discussed ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296343799209985))
	- 2. Hone Your Body Language (7-38-55 Rule)
	  
	  People will like/dislike your communication based on:
	  
	  • 7% words
	  • 38% tonality and face
	  • 55% body language
	  
	  Stand up straight, pull your shoulders back, make eye contact, smile, give a firm handshake...
	  
	  You will be dangerous. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296344671633410))
	- 3. Master the 4-Bullet Update
	  
	  Powerful people are busy.
	  
	  (They might not remember what they asked you to do.)
	  
	  Give an update with this outline:
	  
	  • Here’s what you asked me to do
	  • Here’s what I did
	  • Here are the risks/blockers (if any)
	  • If given more time, I'd do this ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296347184111616))
	- 4. Record and Study Your Speaking
	  
	  The best communicator I know told me her secret:
	  
	  She records her calls.
	  
	  Then she replays them, studies them
	  
	  (like an athlete watching game film).
	  
	  You’ll cut ‘ums’ and ‘likes.’
	  
	  99.9% won’t do this. Be the outlier. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296348102582274))
	- 5. Ask Rapport-Building Questions
	  
	  Your network is your net worth.
	  
	  Build bonds with these Qs:
	  
	  • What neighborhood are you in?
	  • Do you have any siblings/kids?
	  • How'd you meet your partner? (if mentioned)
	  • Any fun upcoming trips?
	  
	  Simple, but most people miss this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296349147054080))
	- 6. Send ‘Friday Highlights’
	  
	  If you're new to a team, do this to build trust.
	  
	  Every Friday, send your supervisor(s) a short email.
	  
	  Two parts:
	  
	  1) Highlights from the prior week
	  
	  • Big tasks completed
	  • People networked with
	  • Extracurriculars (like affinity groups) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296350094876675))
	- 2) Upcoming activities for next week
	  
	  • Forward-looking big tasks and networking
	  
	  ---
	  
	  Friday Highlights will help you:
	  
	  • Build trust
	  • Hold yourself accountable
	  • Tactfully self-promote (perception is reality)
	  • Have everything you need for self-reviews ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296352292786176))
	- 7. Don’t Complain or Gossip. Ever.
	  
	  Nobody likes to hear complaining.
	  
	  So why do we do it ourselves?
	  
	  (Respectfully standing up for yourself is different.)
	  
	  Separately, when you talk bad about others,
	  
	  people wonder if you talk bad about them too.
	  
	  Just don’t do it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1544296355119636480))
