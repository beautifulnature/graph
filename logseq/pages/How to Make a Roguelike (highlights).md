	- What you need to do is make a beeline for your target. With a basic plan and understanding of where to go, you can start with strong fundamentals and *then*, when you have that fun core game, expand on it all you want! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6qgw1j9jg637qj1wcz4v8n))

	- So what does a small roguelike really need? A core mechanic. This is where the experience starts. It should be explainable in a single sentence and this is what you want to prototype first. Go straight for the fun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6qkc46wz2805nfnp09s25x))
	- your game *only* has this mechanic, is it fun? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6qkgghz67y197mr5g5cf1e))
	- Think about what the player is doing from minute-to-minute, which presumably has something to do with this core mechanic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6qkpgy8f3cecd7fnk201vd))

	- [Knight](https://bitbucket.org/derrickcreamer/forays-into-norrendrin/downloads/Knight.zip) is all about controlling your momentum. You’re mounted on a horse most of the time and that little blue block in the center or so is all you can move, only one space per turn, and that’s where you’ll end up next turn. So you can only accelerate, turn, and slow down so quickly, meaning you have to plan in order to line up your attacks on moving foes to behead them with your sword as you pass.

	- There’s [Mage Guild](http://web.archive.org/web/20160312005831/http://lukossoftware.com/node/8), which has the greatest alchemy system that let’s you mix *any two items*, be they potions, monster remains, or whatever, and get all kinds of interesting new items and effects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6qx8nvn0xavgczm0va25j3))
	- One of the most important things you’ll need access to for roguelike development is *information*. That includes learning the basics, getting answers to questions, getting into more advanced topics later, or just food for thought.

	- We have lots and lots of fantasy dungeon crawlers, so naturally if you want to really distinguish your project, go for any unique theme that’s *not* a fantasy dungeon crawler ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6xp9djwpwmpf4sdmg17sm8))

	- In particular, historical and mythological themes offer a huge range of established material to explore and expand upon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6ybkhh014ddfzj7wecsak0))
	- People also always seem to want more sci-fi roguelikes than what we already have, a relatively underexplored group of themes compared to how broad it is, and how much sci-fi content we see out there in other genres and mediums. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6ybh7dxhfrwpgzh47gjkxs))
	- Besides Sharing Saturday it’s also nice to concentrate all the info about your development in one place. A public place. Blogging actually has a bunch of advantages; here’s a list of some of the major ones:
	  
	  •   organize your thoughts
	  •   examine your work from a different angle
	  •   document the process
	  •   create a useful long-term reference
	  •   get feedback
	  •   build a community ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg6ywtpa8nddm9v8f1rmz94z))
