	- Even though there are literally thousands of books on software engineering, not many are really useful or career changing. That said, let's try and name the books that you consider to be important in your career, how you understand the field, your current skills and depth of knowledge.
	  Let me start:
	  
	  1. Designing Data Intensive Applications
	  
	  This book doesn't need any additional praise, but it's just brilliant how it manages to be both highly technical and very readable (and even capturing).
	  
	  2. The Pragmatic Programmer
	  
	  I wish I had read it years ago. It reads like a great conversation with an incredibly experienced friend of yours
	  
	  3. Philosophy of Software Design
	  
	  It's debatable whether this book is the better replacement for Clean Code, but I really like how nuanced and undogmatic it is.
	- 1. Leaders Eat Last Deluxe: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't
	  We gave this to every employee at the business, as it models the type of culture and leaders we wanted to grow. For me personally, it put down on paper what I had been trying to do for years. It was something I reread often to try to improve my manager/leadership skills. This type of thinking helped me become a better CEO (it wasn't instant).
	  2. Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works
	  Great books on tactics and strategy; it helped me improve why we did things and created a much better approach to problems.
	  3. 4. Lean B2B: Build Products Businesses Want and The Lean Product Playbook: How to Innovate with Minimum Viable Products and Rapid Customer Feedback
	- = Out of the Crisis by Deming.
	  Everyone ought to read and absorb Deming. It's hands-down the most life-changing read I've ever come across, by a wide margin.
	  Dealing with life statistically rather than overreacting to randomness means it's possible to achieve much higher levels of effeciveness and productivity. Working with people to unleash their inner motivation is vastly superior to trying to carrot-and-whip them around.
	  Understanding that a specific process will yield a specific outcome, whatever outcome you wish for, is how to avoid getting the same result over and over while thinking you ought to see something different because gosh-darned if you aren't trying really hard!!
	  = Willful Ignorance by Weisberg.
	  This isn't that good a book, in that it doesn't cover very much content at all, but it really gave me a good intuition for what statistics and probability is about that has helped me understand more advanced things than I was able to before.
	  Both this book and Deming will take a few years to digest. You'll want to practise it in real life, then come back to read it again, then practise some more. Eventually the lessons will start to stick.
	  = Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems by Mor Halchor-Balter.
	  Despite the name, this is a book about queueing theory. You know, that branch of statistics that shows up literally everywhere, except nobody seems to understand that it does. I have been dabbling in queueing theory before this book, but the focus this book put on practical applications really made me understand it on a deeper level than before.
	  = Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers.
	  I didn't originally want to put this one in this list because it's so predictable, but I can't not. I keep coming back to it and re-reading portions of it every time I have to deal with tricky code. It's just that good at explaining clever ways to get things under test, so they can be worked on with confidence.
	  = How to Measure Anything by Douglas Hubbard.
	  What I really take away from this is how powerful it is to be able to estimate ranges that are true 90 % of the time. It's hard to convince others of what a superpower this is, but I hope to work with people who understand that some day.
	- I’m still looking for a more science-backed book on influence and persuasion and I’m currently looking at Influence + Persuasion from the HBR Emotional Intelligence series. Would be happy to hear about others’ recommendations as well.
	- 1. Data Analysis with Open Source Tools
	  This learnt me how to analyze "small" datasets which have helped me incredibly in my career. Technology wise is very out of date, but the concepts are still valid.
	  I think it's hard to get more with less investmtent. Really underrated book.
	  2. Expert Oracle Database Architecture
	  If you have to develop on Oracle (something I undestand it's not very popular in HN), you have to read it. It's a great book that delves into the why's and not only into the how's.
	  3. Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art.
	  Only the "cone of uncertainty" concept would make it a must-read. It provided me a framework for doing estimations and at same time, to worry less about them. It has helped me to divert lots of uncomfortable conversations about "when" towards a much more productive "what-and-why-is-needed
	- 1. Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, Walker
	  2. Quantum Mechanics by Eisberg, Resnick
	  3. Mathematical Physics by Arfken, Weber, Harris
	  4. Introduction to Statistical Learning with R by Hastie et al.
	  5. Deep Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard
	- * Getting Real, by 37signals: Gave me confidence to side-step a lot of the bs I saw in software development practice
	  * The Mythical Man-Month, Fred Brooks: Provided an argument against inexperienced managers who errantly assert that they need more developers to get projects done quicker; perhaps more importantly, it gives as a model for a programming team with a "chief programmer" to whom these managers need to report
	  * The Timeless Way of Building, Christopher Alexander: Taught me the original (perhaps better) concept of design patterns, which helped in talking to colleagues about the parts of software we build and reuse
	  * JavaScript: the Good Parts, Douglas Crockford: Led me to a solid understanding of how to make good use a crummy scripting language that was only really meant to glue DOM behavior to Java applets
	- 1. The Millionaire Next Door - I read this as a kid and took away the importance of owning your own business and living below your means.
	  2. The Good Earth - Another book that I read as a kid that I think about often…specifically about the choices the family makes as their fortune rises and falls.
	  3. Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works - I like the 1 page canvas for capturing assumptions and the product & solution interviews.
	  More recently, I read Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals. I wonder if the central message of this book (“you can’t do it all & how to embrace that”) will stick with me.

	- 1. Effective Java. The mentality/no-nonsense approach more than anything...the language itself not my favorite these days.
	  2. Headfirst Java. A stepping stone book like above, but it was very helpful in progressing from "here are variables and control statements" to here are the wide range of things a language can do in the later sections.
	  3. TCP/IP Illustrated. I never really saw the use in pulling back the curtain of some these lower level details in most modern development, but having pulled it back I can say it is absolutely useful/enlightening/worthwhile.
	  4. The Haskell Road to Logic. Educational exploring some math and logic through the lens of a programming language.
