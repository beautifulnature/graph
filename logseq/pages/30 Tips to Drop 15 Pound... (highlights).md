	- 30 tips to drop 15 pounds in the next month:
	  
	  1. Stop drinking alcohol. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715490743754754))
	- 2. Stop drinking your calories (stick to water, coffee, tea).
	  3. Determine your maintenance calories and eat 300-500 calories below that number (daily).
	  4. Use MyFitnessPal to count calories.
	  5. Ditch the all or nothing mindset. Focus on long term sustainability. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715513464360960))
	- 6. Wake up 60 minutes earlier to get a workout in.
	  7. Increase your cardio (10k steps daily or spend 20 minutes on the treadmill after each training session).
	  8. Fix your sleep schedule. For the next 30 days wake up and go to sleep at the same time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715535727656961))
	- 9. Determine your why (do you want to live longer? be more confident? be fit for your family?). Once you have your why, showing up becomes easier.
	  10. Only eat food & do exercises that you enjoy (have a plan for both). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715558158893058))
	- 11. Commit to going to the gym 5x a week. Do everything in your power to get there (layout your clothes the night before, have your shake made, etc).
	  12. When you're hungry, drink water instead of snacking. 90% of the time you think you're hungry, you are just dehydrated. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715580346671105))
	- 13. Find an accountability partner (wife/husband, a friend, a family member). It's easy to let yourself down, it's hard to let someone else down.
	  14. Create a list of 3-4 high protein meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Stick to these.
	  15. Stick to whole foods and protein. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715602547216387))
	- 16. Set a daily protein & calorie goal (be within 10% of it every day).
	  17. Get at least 30 minutes of sunlight in the morning. 
	  18. Eliminate the option of choice. If you have junk food in your house, you're going to eat it.
	  19. Form > Weight. Always. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715624798011394))
	- 20. Buy a big water bottle. Drink 2-3 of them per day.
	  21. Do the simple things well (hydration, calorie & protein intake, lifting, cardio, and sleep).
	  22. Spend 30 minutes learning about nutrition (what protein, fats, and carbs are + what they do/how they affect your body). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715647128371201))
	- 23. Track your progress in the gym. Use your phone or a journal to ensure you're increasing weight weekly.
	  24. Weigh yourself daily.
	  25. Take progress pictures (weekly). Tracking your progress lets you know you're on the right track. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715669555314690))
	- 26. Identify as a healthy person. When you don't know what to do ask yourself: "What choice would a healthy person make right now?"
	  27. Don't rely on motivation. You need to show up regardless of how you're feeling. That's how you build discipline & consistency. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715691776839681))
	- 28. Believe in yourself. Losing weight is simple math. You need to burn more calories than you eat. Once you figure out how, it's easy. 
	  29. Get started today and you'll be a new person 1 year from now. Stop saying you'll start Monday, next month, next year. Do it NOW. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715714224771073))
	- 30. Be patient. Improving your health is a long term goal. Your goal isn't to be in shape for 1 year, it's to be in shape for the rest of your life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715736458674182))
	- Get started today.
	  
	  Sustainable change takes time and you need to learn what works best for YOU.
	  
	  There is no special diet or exercise program that will make the weight disappear.
	  
	  I promise getting in shape is the best thing you'll ever do for yourself and your family. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRiAnderson/status/1574715758831194112))
