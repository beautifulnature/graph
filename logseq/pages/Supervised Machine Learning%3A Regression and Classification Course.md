- # Overview
	- Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to do things without explicit programming.
	- AI and machine learning is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030
- # Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
	- In the 1950s Arthur Samual wrote a program that played checkers against itself
	- There two main types of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
	- ## Supervised Learning
		- Supervised learning learns from data **labeled** with the right answers
		- Right answer means the correct label y for a given input x
		- By seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output
		- ### Regression
			- You may use regression to predict a number, such as house price based on square feet.
			- You may use a straight light, curved line, or something more complicated

		- ### Classification
			- Instead of predicting a number like regression, classification predict categories, like malignient or beignine when predicting cancer
			- There can be be two or more categories.

	- ## Unsupervised Learning
		- Unsupervised learning finds structure in unlabeled data, You don't give it the right answer
		- For example, grouping news articles into the same story or discovering marketing segments of customers
		- Clustering groups similar data together
		- Anomaly Detection is finding unusual data points
		- Dimensionality reduction compresses data using fewer numbers
	- ## Jupyter Notebooks
		- Environment to code and experiment with machine learning
