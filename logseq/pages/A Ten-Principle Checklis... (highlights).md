	- A ten-principle checklist for socio-technical design 
	  
	  by Albert Cherns, quoted by Jackson in Critical Systems Thinking
	  
	  paraphrased by me, with commentary for software teams ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171031928332288))
	- Compatibility
	  the process of design is compatible with its objectives. Want democracy? use participative design.
	  
	  The means match the ends.
	  You don't get autonomous teams by specifying Scrum. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171033392128003))
	- Minimal Critical Specification
	  of the who and how of carrying out the work, only the essentials are decided up-front.
	  
	  Figure out the basics, and plan on figuring out more later, within the team. Keep detailed decisions near the work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171034805706753))
	- The Multifunction Principle
	  for flexibility and equifinality, each individual can perform more than one function.
	  
	  "equifinality" means "depending on what comes up, this may play out in a lot of different ways, but the result is the same."
	  People can cover for each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171038614147074))
	- Boundary Location
	  Control of team activities is with the members; the manager concentrates on boundary activities
	  
	  The manager makes sure the team gets what it needs, and knows what the org needs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171039926853632))
	- Support Congruence
	  social support should reinforce the org structure. If you work in teams, give bonuses to teams--not individuals.
	  
	  Promotions and reviews reward teamwork, not heroism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171042992951297))
	- Power and Authority
	  the resources you need to do the work--you have authority to take them and responsibility to use them well.
	  
	  Hooray cloud! Hooray allocating my own compute! Give us access to all the observability and let us deploy, please. #cloud ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171045966643200))
	- Incompletion (my favorite)
	  design is an iterative process
	  
	  We are never "done," not at writing the software or designing how we work. The world is changing, we are changing, the learning continues. #symmathesy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1546171047652761602))
