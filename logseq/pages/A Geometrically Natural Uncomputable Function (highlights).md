	- There are many functions from to that cannot be computed by any algorithm or computer program. For example, a famous one is the [halting problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), defined by if the th Turing machine halts and if the th Turing machine does not halt. Another one in the same spirit is the [busy beaver function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver_function). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gft3n2wjzs720fmzgppy4sf2))
