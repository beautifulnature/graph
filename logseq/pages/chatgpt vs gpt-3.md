description:: Is ChatGPT better than GPT-3? I run some tests to find out.
blogtitle:: Comparing ChatGPT vs GPT-3
math:: true

- OpenAI recently released its ChatGPT API. ChatGPT was previously only available as a web app, but now developers can build new applications on top of this technology.
- The most notable thing about the ChatGPT API is its price. OpenAI has stated that it is 90% cheaper than earlier models available via API, such as the GPT-3 text-davinci-003. Before, I was spending around \$7 a month with moderate usage of GPT-3 for notetaking, but now I'm spending less than 1\$ per month using ChatGPT.
- Although the name "chat" might suggest a conversational use case, OpenAI claims that the ChatGPT API is as good as the davinci model for non-chat use cases and single actions tasks such as summarizing an article. They recommend using the ChatGPT API instead of the earlier models for most use cases.
- I recently upgraded the Logseq OpenAI GPT-3 plugin to utilize the new ChatGPT by default, which means that users can expect to spend 90% less while still receiving quality results.
- The output is very similar to previous models, but the biggest improvement I've noticed is it's less likely to make up or "hallucinate" answers.
- In one of OpenAI's examples, they show that if you ask it a nonsensical question like:
- > Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015
- ChatGPT will identify that the question doesn't make sense, but GPT-3 will make up an answer about Christopher Columbus arriving in 2015.
- In one of my tests I ask it to:
- > Describe yoda from star wars
- ![File:Yoda Empire Strikes Back.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back.png?20130903062129){:height 296, :width 250}
- ChatGPT describes him accurately, however GPT-3 often gets details wrong, such as describing him as having a "long pointed beard"
- I tested this with other fictional characters, and ChatGPT consistently gets the details correct, and GPT-3 very often adds incorrect details.
- ## Downsides
	- In general, ChatGPT performs better than GPT-3 in most use cases I've tried. However, there are some downsides.
	- For instance, it is more conversational and adds dialogue like "As a language model" or "Sure! Here you go:" to its answers, whereas earlier models would just answer the questions directly. Additionally, the model is more hesitant to answer subjective questions than earlier models.
	- Since I'm using the API in the context of a notetaking plugin, and not a chatbot, I don't want these conversational bits added.
	- I was able to reduce the frequency it added conversational phrases by adding this as a "system message", which guides how ChatGPT should respond.
	- > Do not refer to yourself in your answers. Do not answer in a conversational way. Do not say as an AI language model.
	- Even though OpenAI recommends it over GPT-3 for most use cases, I would be careful using it as a replacement for GPT-3 for non-chat use cases since it often inserts chat-like dialog into the answers.
	- Nonetheless, the ChatGPT API provides a significant improvement in terms of cost while still delivering good results for most applications.
- # Tests
	- In the Logseq OpenAI plugin, you can customize which OpenAI model to use, and can choose between ChatGPT and GPT-3.
	- I performed several tests comparing the output of ChatGPT and GPT-3 on the same input.

				- In the far reaches of the Bloodspire Continent, where the sun bowed in submission to the ever-present darkness, a land forsaken by gods and shunned by mortals lay shrouded in shadows. The Kingdom of Nocturna, where the passage of time was marked not by days, but by the slow, treacherous creep of despair. Here, the inhabitants bowed to the yoke of an ancient, malevolent force that had slumbered for a thousand years, and now stirred once more, threatening to engulf the world in a suffocating embrace of eternal night.
				  
				  A cold, soulless wind howled through the twisted, blackened trees of the Grimwood, carrying with it the whispers of a thousand lost souls. The forest was a sprawling graveyard, where every gnarled root and knotted branch bore witness to the horrifying secrets buried beneath the rotting undergrowth.
			- ### ChatGPT
				- In a land far beyond the reach of mortal men, where the skies were forever the color of an impending storm, a great evil lurked. It slithered and crept through the shadows of the twisted, gnarled trees, and its eyes gleamed with an ominous, other-worldly glow that seemed to pierce the very souls of those who dared to look upon it.
				  
				  The villagers of the small hamlet that lay nearby spoke of this evil in hushed whispers, afraid that even uttering its name aloud would summon it forth from its hiding place. They knew, however, that it was there, and it watched them, waiting for the right moment to strike.
			- ### GPT-3
				- The small hamlet of Risborough was a clean and bustling place, abundant with meadows, woods, and winding streams. For generations, its residents had led idyllic lives of tradition, comfort, and peace. 
				  
				  But this was all about to change. 
				  
				  On a gloomy day, a chill settled over the hamlet, as if the air itself had grown heavy with an unknown anxiety. A dark shadow seemed to camouflage the trees, deeking them into obscurity, and the sky became a lightless slate blanket. And somewhere, deep within the bowels of the woods, a sharp beeping sound - like the tolling of a funeral bell - echoed through the pine trees. 
				  
				  The villagers knew they should be cautious, but none of them had the slightest idea of what lay ahead.

		  If deep learning is a subset of machine learning, how do they differ? Deep learning distinguishes itself from classical machine learning by the type of data that it works with and the methods in which it learns.
		  
		  Machine learning algorithms leverage structured, labeled data to make predictions—meaning that specific features are defined from the input data for the model and organized into tables. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it doesn’t use unstructured data; it just means that if it does, it generally goes through some pre-processing to organize it into a structured format.
		  
		  Deep learning eliminates some of data pre-processing that is typically involved with machine learning. These algorithms can ingest and process unstructured data, like text and images, and it automates feature extraction, removing some of the dependency on human experts. For example, let’s say that we had a set of photos of different pets, and we wanted to categorize by “cat”, “dog”, “hamster”, et cetera. Deep learning algorithms can determine which features (e.g. ears) are most important to distinguish each animal from another. In machine learning, this hierarchy of features is established manually by a human expert.
		  
		  Then, through the processes of gradient descent and backpropagation, the deep learning algorithm adjusts and fits itself for accuracy, allowing it to make predictions about a new photo of an animal with increased precision.  
		  
		  Machine learning and deep learning models are capable of different types of learning as well, which are usually categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning utilizes labeled datasets to categorize or make predictions; this requires some kind of human intervention to label input data correctly. In contrast, unsupervised learning doesn’t require labeled datasets, and instead, it detects patterns in the data, clustering them by any distinguishing characteristics. Reinforcement learning is a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward.

		- ### ChatGPT
			- > 1. Lack of transparency: One of the common objections to deep learning neural networks is that they are often considered to be a "black box." This means that it can be difficult to fully understand how the algorithms work, and there is little transparency on how the models are making their predictions or classifications.
			  2. High computational requirements: Deep learning neural networks require significant computational resources, such as powerful GPUs, to process large amounts of data. This high computational requirement can often be a barrier for smaller organizations or individuals.
			  3. Overfitting: Another potential objection to deep learning neural networks is the risk of overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and starts to fit the noise in the training data instead of the true patterns. This can lead to poor performance when tested on new data.
			  4. Limited interpretability: Deep learning neural networks can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why certain decisions or classifications are being made. This lack of interpretability can be especially problematic in certain industries where transparency is necessary (e.g., finance, healthcare).
			  5. Data bias: Deep learning neural networks are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, the model will also be biased. This can perpetuate inequalities and perpetuate systemic biases.
