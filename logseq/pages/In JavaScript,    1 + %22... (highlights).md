	- In JavaScript,
	  
	   1 + "1"  â†’  11
	  But,
	   1 - "1"  â†’   0
	  
	  Here is why ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuhailKakar/status/1541674379465019392))
	- â†’ We all know that 1 + 1 = 2, and 1-1=0 but how does the JavaScript Engine compute give the first answer 11 and the second answer 0.

	- â†’ In computer programming, Concatenation, in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. The term"concatenation" literally means to merge two things together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuhailKakar/status/1541674389493522432))
	- â†’ Similarly in JavaScript, The + is a concatenation operator for strings. Therefore the number is subsequently transformed into a string and concatenated as a result. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuhailKakar/status/1541674392014311424))
	- â†’ To make it more clear, The + operator in Javascript (as in many other languages) has two different Jobs: It acts as an addition operator, and as a string concatenation operator. In our case, the concatenation takes precedence over the addition of numbers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuhailKakar/status/1541674394539286528))
	- â†’ However, the 2nd case is called concatenation. The "-" is only for numeric, both operands are converted to numeric and thus give a numeric answer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuhailKakar/status/1541674397936668672))
