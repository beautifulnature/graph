	- 1. Start being active
	  
	  An obvious tip, but one often forgotten
	  
	  Twitter won't work if you don't tweet
	  
	  General rule of thumb for building an audience
	  
	  Start with 1 tweet & 5 replies per day - every day
	  
	  Experiment with this and find what works for you
	  
	  But make sure to be active ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816096257888256))
	- Don't focus on just your bio
	  
	  Make sure to add an avatar that represents you
	  
	  A semi professional headshot is great here - Don't be too corporate
	  
	  And add a real name to your profile too
	  
	  A pseudo name or avatar can also be used, if you'd prefer ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816102209585152))
	- 3. Build connections
	  
	  Now people know who you are, get to know them a little better 
	  
	  Find people in areas that interest you
	  
	  Reach out, say hi
	  
	  Have chats in replies and deeper conversations in DMs 
	  
	  Your twitter connections are your superpower ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816104742965248))
	- 4. Keep going
	  
	  Not everyone will want to connect. Not everyone will want to hire you.
	  
	  That's okay
	  
	  You're not selling anything at this point
	  
	  All you're doing is demonstrating your expertise and meeting new and interesting people
	  
	  Make friends and enjoy the ride ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816107351871488))
	- 5. Be patient
	  
	  Now you have friends all over the world who know what you do
	  
	  Who do you think will be the first person they think of when:
	  
	  Their team needs a freelancer
	  They have a project idea
	  Someone asks them to recommend a freelancer
	  
	  ~it's you~ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816109956489216))
	- And that's it!
	  
	  Have a question? Ask away!

	- Bonus round!
	  
	  Create a portfolio website and link to it from your profile
	  
	  A portfolio can sell your work more traditionally than twitter
	  
	  Is also much easier to find case studies there and blogging can further build your authority
	  
	  Not necessary, but a great extra ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816120370946048))
	- You need to be consistent. I've been here 2 years, and have been a lot less consistent this year - the interest has also been lower
	  
	  You're making friends first, so don't immediately try to sell. A support network can be great even if they don't bring you work ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/status/1537816125521571840))
