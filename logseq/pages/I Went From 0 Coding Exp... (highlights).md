	- I went from 0 coding experience to landing a job as a developer in 6 months...and spent $0 doing it
	  
	  Here are the topics I focused on and some FREE resources you can use to do the same (warning: 100s of hours of content) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421050888028160))
	- Getting comfortable using Github is an absolute must
	  
	  You're going to be using it in everything you do, so getting a hang of all the commands early will save you countless hours in the future
	  
	  Set a reminder to push something to GitHub every day until it becomes second nature

	- 2. HTML/CSS - The peanut butter and jelly of making webpages
	  
	  HTML is used to structure your webpage
	  
	  CSS is used to make that structure pretty
	  
	  This video will teach you the basics and walk you through building your 1st webpage - a Youtube clone!

	- The toughest part about CSS is learning to position things
	  
	  Mastering the flexbox layout module solves this
	  
	  Flexbox froggy is an amazing game that'll get you comfortable with this important skill quickly (plus it's kinda fun!)

	- 3. Javascript - The swiss army knife of web dev
	  
	  JS is still by far the most in-demand coding language in the world
	  
	  Here are a few things it's good for:
	- Before diving in and trying to add functionality to your web pages using JS, you'll want to get a feel for the basics
	  
	  Complete these 10 short JS fundamentals courses on freeCodeCamp (Will take a few weeks but 100% worth the time youll save in the future)
	  
	  https://t.co/YhCExDM5UC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421076142043137))
	- Once you've got the fundamentals down, kill two birds with one stone and start working on your own personal portfolio page.
	  
	  You can iterate on this and make it look prettier as you refine your skills.
	  
	  This video is an amazing reference to get started.

	- 4. Learn CRUD Operations by Making a To Do list app
	  
	  CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete
	  
	  It allows you to manipulate data in any of those ways and is one of the most important topics to master in web dev
	  
	  Build this app multiple times

	- 5. APIs - Integrating live data into your apps
	  
	  Now that you can whip together a badass frontend and work with data, its time to get comfortable communicating with databases
	  
	  This video is PACKED with info and will get you set up with your first database
	  
	  https://t.co/p1k7JWxgSF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421083964338177))
	- Once you feel like you have a firm grasp on making API requests, go back to the apps that you made when learning HTML/CSS and level them up by adding in data
	  
	  Here's an awesome directory with tons of public APIs you can use for free to do just that
	  
	  https://t.co/SICuE6HFip ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421086573187073))
	- I highly recommend pulling data into all of the web apps on your portfolio page
	  
	  API integration is one of the skills that takes your development to the next level
	  
	  You can also make yourself sound a lot smarter than you really are in interviews by breaking down APIs you've used ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421089194676224))
	- 7. Learn React
	  
	  React is arguably the most in-demand skill for front-end devs to have
	  
	  Mastering it will take your front-end game to the next level, allowing you to build fast, dynamic, and user-friendly single-page applications

	- Youll have to build multiple React apps until you start to get the hang of it
	  
	  This 8-hour-long walkthrough of building a social media app using the MERN stack is a great place to start (You'll be using everything mentioned up till this point to build it)

	- 8. Spend a month refining your portfolio page and build a passion project
	  
	  If you dont have a CS degree, youll need to find another way to get your foot in the door and land interviews (its tough)
	  
	  Build something youre proud of and blast it on your resume/linkedin/portfolio page ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421101752438785))
	- The stock trading simulator I built as a passion project is what got recruiters interested the most and also gave me tons to talk about during the interview itself
	  
	  Build the app around something you love, the passion will show even more and interviewers tend to like seeing that ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421104285794304))
	- 9. Practice Data Structure/Algorithm problems
	  
	  Once you land an interview, you're inevitably going to need to solve a couple coding problems on the spot
	  
	  Codewars was huge for me here. It gamifies coding questions and makes the process fun.

	- To wrap this all up, its important to note that none of this works if you don't put in the time
	  
	  Personally I dedicated 8-12 hours a day for half a year straight before landing a job
	  
	  Its a tough process, but I truly believe anyone can do it with enough time put in ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1574421109461524480))
	- Ironically enough, I quit my job a year later after achieving financial freedom via NFTs
	  
	  If you're interested, I write about them weekly here:
