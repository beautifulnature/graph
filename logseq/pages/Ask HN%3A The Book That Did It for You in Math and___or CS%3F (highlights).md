	- > My dad gave me his book he used in the 70s
	  
	  That would probably be the second edition, published in 1967. The first edition was in 1961.
	  
	  If you have a kid and they go to a college that uses Apostol you can give them your 2nd edition without worrying that it will be too far off from the current edition because the second edition *is* the current edition.
	  
	  Same with volume 2. The 1969 second edition is the current edition. The first edition was in 1962.
	  
	  Anyone happen to know of a list somewhere that lists subjects and for each gives you information on how well it can be learned from old books?
	  
	  For undergraduate calculus for example a 50 year old textbook is fine. At worst some of the example and exercises might be outdated or maybe mildly sexist by today's standards.
	  
	  On the other hand, that 20 year old book on learning Java with Symmantec Visual Cafe sitting on one of my bookshelves is probably nearly completely useless.
	  
	  In between would be books where parts of them are still relevant and accurate and parts of them have been superseded and would at best only be worth reading for historical purposes.
	  
	  
	  _Algebraic Topology_ by Allen Hatcher. This is quite an advanced book, but it was the first topology book I picked up and it blew my mind. Without a serious math background you may only be able to read the first parts (some of chapters 0 and chapter 1), but even so it may amaze you. It was insane to see how much mathematical machinery can be built up to understand concepts as simple as “space” and “continuity.” Then these tools can be used to quickly prove facts about mind-boggling higher dimensional objects.
	  
	  _Introduction to Quantum Mechanics_ by David Griffiths. Not CS or Math, but an amazing book because if you sit down and work through it it gives you a manageable intro to a completely non-intuitive and mysterious scientific field. Prerequisites are “only” multivariable calc and linear algebra.
	  
	  _Algebra_ by Michael Artin. This was the book I decided to grind through at the right time to learn abstract algebra and get better at rigorous proofs, and it was worth it. Part of why I loved this book and subject is because it feels dry and mechanical at first, but if you work on it long enough you can see the beautiful bigger picture come together.
	  
	  _Introduction to Topological Manifolds_ by John M. Lee. This was another “right book at the right time” for me. The title is a bit jargony, but it is a rigorous introduction to the foundational objects of modern geometry (namely topological spaces and manifolds in particular). Great warm-up for the first book on my list.
	  
	  _Algebra: Chapter 0_ by Paulo Aluffi. Weird title, but the first few chapters are the best perspective on abstract algebra I’ve seen. He focuses early on categories in a useful and philosophically interesting way, which is unique.
	  
	  _Gravitation_ by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler. Didn’t read the whole thing, but this book taught me a tensor is just a higher-order linear function. Who knew? Most physicists give really crappy explanations of tensors. Also I love that this book, affectionately known as the “phone book”, is so heavy that one imagines spacetime curving around it.
	  
	  
	  Here are 3 applied math gems:
	  
	  1) Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos by Strogatz completely changed my relationship with applied math. I'd studied diffyqs and PDEs earlier but that was under duress and hasn't been particularly useful. Traditional books don't tell you that analysis solves only a tiny subset of important real-world problems, and for me, were just another boring dose of plug-and-chug calculus.
	  
	  Strogatz immediately motivates the subject and uses analysis as a jumping-off point (with some pretty hard analytical HW problems!), but he quickly pivots to numerical methods with a very strong intuitive and visual/geometric approach. Years later, I'm using this knowledge surprisingly often.
	  
	  2) Linear Programming by Chvatal was the book that made LP duality really click for me. Prior to reading Chvatal I mechanically understood duality but with no intuition. Chvatal explains duality from a bounding perspective, and even better, motivates duality through simple dimensional analysis, just like in physics! (The Strogatz book above also motivates dimensional analysis and dimensionless groups, which has been very useful to me over the long term.)
	  
	  3) Statistical Methods: The Geometric Approach, Saville and Wood was my bridge from meaningless opaque algebraic and calculus stats to a solid understanding. The book builds everything on vector space projections at the level of undergrad linear algebra. Even a simple mean of 3 numbers now sparkles with intuition and insight.
	  
	  They also published a short paper that conveys the key ideas [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684537](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684537)
	  
	  
	  I will recommend books that I have and books that I heard of:
	  
	  Books that sparked my interest in all of Mathematics (BTW, I'll be glad if you recommend any Abstract Algebra books):

	  I will recommend books that I have and books that I heard of:
	  
	  Books that sparked my interest in all of Mathematics (BTW, I'll be glad if you recommend any Abstract Algebra books):
	- Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes made programming click for me when I was in my second year in college. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsz5bdbdbapddbxcbae7xhe))
	- Learning to Reason: An Introduction to Logic, Sets, and Relations" by Nancy Rodgers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsz5fwyb1mb4dbmc4631633))
	- one of the very best intros to elementary number theory is "Number Theory: Step By Step" by Kuldeep Singh ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsz60p8rn91tbsnt92fe3c5))
	- more textbooks on discrete math like, say, " Essential Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science" by Lewis & Zax or "Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction" by Oscar Levin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsz71yrssq3q4dvsab03sm2))
	- Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics" by Chartrand, Polimeni, Zhang. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsz7pc907a7x593ckc1588h))

	- One of the most effective textbooks on elementary math analysis is "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" by Rudin. But one will have a real tough time with it even after studying the aforementioned books. But there are fantastic preparatory books like "Linear Algebra: Step by Step" by Kuldeep Singh which one needs because Rudin considers Euclidean Spaces proper, not just the reals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsz8czfzgp9zmhxsv5r0ttw))
