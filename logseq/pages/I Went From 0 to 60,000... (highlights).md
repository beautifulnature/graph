	- 1. How to pick a topic to write about:
	  
	  Pick a topic that meets 3 criteria:
	  
	  1. You are interested in it
	  
	  2. You are good at it (or want to get good at it)
	  
	  3. Other people are interested in reading about it
	  
	  In my case, those topics were marketing and psychology. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heykahn/status/1545040180830056448))

	- 2. How to find ideas to write about:
	  
	  • Consume books, podcasts, and articles about your topic.
	  
	  • Every time you come across an idea, write it down.
	  
	  • Collect and organize ideas in a word file or diary. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heykahn/status/1545040183585714178))

	- 3. How to write compelling content:
	  
	  • Make it catchy. The first line of your post should catch the reader's attention.
	  
	  • Keep it simple. Avoid complicated words.
	  
	  • Keep it short. Delete extra words and keep your sentences short. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heykahn/status/1545040186240708608))

	- 4. How to go viral:
	  
	  • Post 5 times a week.
	  
	  • Post between 8am - 10am.
	  
	  • Befriend accounts with 1k-10k followers and share your posts with them. If the content is high quality and they engage with it, your content is almost certain to go viral. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heykahn/status/1545040188891488256))

	- 5. How to get more followers:
	  
	  • Optimize your bio and give people a strong reason to follow you.
	  
	  • Focus on practical over emotional. Practical content gets more followers than emotional posts.
	  
	  • Once you have provided value with your post, ask for a follow at the end. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heykahn/status/1545040192129490945))
	- I've shared this playbook with lots of people and seen many of them build 10,000+ followings in 2-3 months.
	  
	  Be consistent and persistent. It can take 4-8 weeks to get your first viral post. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heykahn/status/1545040194834874371))
