	- Probably relevant for the HN crowd: there's a bunch of very geeky next gen fitness guys that keep up with the cutting edge of fitness research, and occasionally expand it themselves. If you're reading them, this kind of thing is being discussed for years, with new studies just moving the odds a bit in favor of the current hypothesis. Yes, they're very Bayesian, explicitly so. A few names/links, pick and mix as you will - they're all good:  https://mennohenselmans.com/high-resistance-training-frequen...  http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/fitness_articles_by_brad_schoe...  https://macrofactorapp.com/articles/  https://rpstrength.com/team-member/mike-israetel-phd  Probably not the best links for each, but it's morning and I got work to do. Should be enough to get you started tho.
