	- Copyleft licenses, for example, of which the GPL is the most notable variant, are committed to the freedom of the source code. Code governed by a copyleft license asks for reciprocity from consumers; if changes to the code base are made and distributed (we’ll come back to that word), they must be released and shared under the original terms. Permissive licenses, on the other hand, are built around freedom for the developer: permissively licensed assets impose few if any restrictions on downstream users, and require no such reciprocity. Both communities are strongly committed to freedom; the difference lies in what, precisely, is kept free. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsy4cby8ms1ejv5dj79b8eh))
	- In Black Duck’s sample, the most popular variant of the GPL – version 2 – is less than half as popular as it was (46% to 19%). Over the same span, the permissive MIT has gone from 8% share to 29%, while its permissive cousin the Apache License 2.0 jumped from 5% to 15% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsy5a9992yr9byp97qt1scg))
	- If you look at this graph of licensed repositories over time, you’ll notice that the percentage of licensed repositories has been decreasing, hovering around 20% throughout GitHub’s history (about 30% if you include forked repositories).

	- **AGPL**:  
	  One question that we field regularly is whether we see potential for the AGPL to make a bid for popularity. For the unfamiliar, the AGPL is a copyleft license like the GPL that unlike the GPL considers hosting an application online to be distribution, thereby triggering the reciprocal requirements – you can read more about it [here](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2012/09/10/agpl/) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsy72xw23kw53q2b3nzp7fw))
