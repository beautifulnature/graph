	- A few months ago, I came across the idea of “anti-goals” from my friend @awilkinson. 
	  
	  It quickly became a staple in my life.
	  
	  I use the anti-goal framework to:
	  • Plan for new projects
	  • Design my life
	  • Create self-improvement plans
	  
	  In this thread, I'll share how it works: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466668524359683))
	- The concept is grounded in inversion—a foundational mental model that says that complex problems are often easier solved backwards vs. forwards.
	  
	  Inversion was made famous by one quote:
	  
	  “All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there." - Charlie Munger

	- With traditional goals, we envision the optimal outcome.
	  
	  We then build systems that will—hopefully—lead to that outcome.
	  
	  This is important and still necessary—but it’s incomplete.
	  
	  Anti-goals leverage inversion to complete the picture.

	- Anti-goals are the things we DON'T want to happen—either as final outcomes or along the way.
	  
	  I think of anti-goals as being about avoiding the "Pyrrhic victory”—a victory that takes such a terrible toll on the victor that it might has well have been a defeat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466679605592064))
	- Ok, so how do you establish anti-goals?
	  
	  My generalized process involves four steps:
	  
	  (1) Choose Your Arena
	  (2) Establish Traditional Goals
	  (3) Invert the Problem
	  (4) Establish Anti-Goals
	  
	  Let’s walk through each step: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466681597911040))
	- Choose Your Arena
	  
	  The arena is the "project" you’re going to be working on.
	  
	  A few broad categories:
	  • Personal
	  • Work
	  • Health
	  
	  Your arena should be a specific project under a larger category.
	  
	  It’s the place where you’re looking for achievement, progress, or growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466682508156934))
	- Establish Traditional Goals
	  
	  These are your standard goals—the desired outcomes from the chosen arena.
	  
	  A few examples:
	  
	  • Run a 6-min mile
	  • Build a 100,000 sub newsletter
	  • Promotion to VP
	  • Create a top-25 podcast
	  
	  Clear, big picture traditional goals are important. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466683544059905))
	- Invert the Problem
	  
	  Ask and answer a few questions.
	  
	  In the pursuit of these goals:
	  
	  • What’s the worst possible outcome?
	  • What systems would lead to that?
	  • What daily actions would I regret?
	  
	  In short, what would you view as winning the battle but losing the war? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466684475179010))
	- Establish Anti-Goals
	  
	  Now work backwards to establish your anti-goals.
	  
	  Expanding on a @JamesClear analogy:
	  
	  If traditional goals are the rudders that set your direction, think of anti-goals as the map that tells you where the rapids are.
	  
	  Awareness keeps you on smooth waters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466685410619392))
	- It can be a bit confusing in the abstract, so let’s look at a recent example from my own life:
	  
	  The Arena: Physical Fitness
	  
	  Traditional Goals:
	  • Run a 6-minute mile
	  • Under 8% bodyfat
	  • Deadlift 500 pounds
	  
	  Perhaps overly-ambitious at 31, but I think doable if I’m dedicated! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466686316486657))
	- Breaking it down, what actions or systems would lead to that worst possible outcome?
	  
	  Trying to do everything myself!
	  
	  Managing my own research on workouts and food.
	  
	  Trying to write, track, and manage my own workout and diet plan.
	  
	  Not scheduling fixed windows for workouts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466688145309697))
	- Establish Anti-Goals:
	  
	  (1) Never think about workouts. Hire a trainer to write workout programs.
	  
	  (2) Never think about diet. Buy pre-prepared healthy meals.
	  
	  (3) Never let workouts consume my life. Schedule 90-minute blocks at the same time every AM as my workout window. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466689206472708))
	- My fitness project now has a complete picture:
	  
	  Traditional Goals:
	  • Run a 6-minute mile
	  • Under 8% bodyfat
	  • Deadlift 500 pounds
	  
	  Anti-Goals:
	  • Never think about workouts—hire trainer.
	  • Never think about diet—buy meals.
	  • Never let workouts consume life—schedule blocks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466690095570944))
	- In his original blog post, @awilkinson has a great example of using anti-goals to design his work.
	  
	  He wanted to pursue success and wealth creation, but not at the expense of his peace of mind.
	  
	  Establishing anti-goals to sit alongside his goals allowed him to do both.

	- To summarize the Anti-Goal Framework:
	  
	  (1) Choose Your Arena
	  (2) Establish Traditional Goals
	  (3) Invert the Problem
	  (4) Establish Anti-Goals
	  
	  So as you take on your next project, establish anti-goals to sit alongside your traditional goals.
	  
	  Win the battle AND the war! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1525466695246151683))
