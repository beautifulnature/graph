	- You Don’t Have To Be Technical as a Product Manager (But You Probably Should Know These 10 Terms Anyway): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854848734347264))
	- Webhooks:
	  
	  Webhooks are APIs in reverse; they let apps send data to each other automatically. Instead of passive APIs, active webhooks don't require polling for updates.
	  
	  Most webhooks are used for small integrations, or getting business apps to talk to each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854855558479876))
	- APIs:
	  
	  APIs, or application programming interfaces, function similarly to drive-thru windows in that they take data and return another set of data. 
	  
	  Most modern applications (even Excel) are a collection of APIs that work together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854864123232256))
	- Containers:
	  
	  Applications are pieces of code using modules and libraries of different versions. There are a lot of dependencies.
	  
	  So applications need environments to know what dependencies to rely on.
	  
	  These environments are put in containers to avoid having mega-environments. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854867201949696))
	- Kubernetes:
	  
	  Most modern apps will have a lot of containers that do different things but need to work together. Kubernetes makes sure that these containers work together and that people like you and me can see them.
	  
	  The Kubernetes ecosystem is complex and intense. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854870658064384))
	- ETL:
	  
	  ETL is the process of moving data between internal systems for analysis.
	  
	  Companies have siloed, dirty, hard-to-work-with data, making quick & effective analysis difficult. ETL is the process of extracting, transforming, and reloading data to make your data analysts happy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854872868454403))
	- Continuous Integration (CI):
	  
	  Developers run tests and automations on their code before shipping it to users. 
	  
	  CI focuses on testing to ensure software works as expected and has no major bugs. 
	  
	  CI uses a server (or third-party service like CircleCI) to run tests. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854881122848771))
	- Continuous Deployment (CD):
	  
	  CD is an engineering philosophy that advocates frequent, small changes. Most teams deploy daily.
	  
	  This requires many tools. Staging servers are environments as close to the app as possible, allowing you to test reliably before releasing a new build. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854883215810562))
	- Frontend/Backend:
	  
	  An app, like the one you're reading on, has a both. 
	  
	  The frontend is the interactive part of the app that users see. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are always used in browsers. 
	  
	  Frontend calls backend for data and workflows (e.g. populating your profile page). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854885279371265))
	- Relational database:
	  
	  Relational databases store and analyse data for applications, like Excel for developers.
	  
	  The default data storage software is MySQL and PostgreSQL. Relational DBs store and organise data using schemas. SQL lets you query and analyse relational DB data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854887829544961))
	- NoSQL: 
	  
	  NoSQL databases have no rules; you can just dump data in them.
	  
	  NoSQL databases are built for big data and fast applications. NoSQL works without a schema, or rules and definitions. 
	  
	  Most NoSQL databases are built to be distributed and resilient, not transactional. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1573854895886798848))
