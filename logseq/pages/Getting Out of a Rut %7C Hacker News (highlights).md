	- As someone in a "rut" recently, one of the things I realized was I needed to stop telling myself the story that I'm in a rut, because describing it as a "rut" focuses on a lot of externals I can't control.
	  When you get a flat tire you can catastrophically repeat over and over to yourself that "I've got a flat!" and point at it and run circles around the car and wonder what you're going to do and "omg I've got a flat this is terrible", or you can start telling yourself the story of the actions you're taking to fix the flat: 1) I'm finding the jack, 2) I'm loosening the lugs 3) I've got the spare ready, 4) you get the idea...
	  Reclaim your power and focus on the positive actions you are taking as minute as those seem in the moment. Meditate deeply on those, maybe even journal them daily so you force your brain to stare at the evidence that while you might feel like you're in a rut you are logically taking good steps through this rut experience.
	- Welcome to depression. You are burned out and fighting for a dopamine hit, hence the overindulgence. From time to time you become motivated to change, which too becomes a source of dopamine, dreaming about doing it, but never following through, because you never have the energy, and motivation is just as fleeting as the high you get from porn, games and food is.
	  The first thing you can do for yourself is changing your environment, or at least your routine, to as significant degree as you are able to, to avoid those frequently taken pathways in your brain that are wired to familiar signals. Non-familiar is your friend. Becoming a father should be able to help with that. We are highly affected by context, so fixing your room and your appearance will also help.
	  The second thing you can do yourself is introspection. You have to start to face the music, no matter how painful. You can't run away from your problems Shinji. To be able to deal with them, you have to identify them. Know thyself. This is where a psychologist can be helpful.
	  The catch is that both of these takes energy, support even, so don't fret if you keep failing, but don't give up either, escapism is not the answer. I have a useful tactic for bridging the intention-action gap:
	  1. Make it easy (effort) by increasing your ability to act or minimizing cost. Tiny steps, worth doing badly.
	  2. Make it attractive (reward, incentive), increasing motivation by highlighting benefits.
	  3. Make it timely.
	  Time and effort discounts the value of reward. We are wired to obtain rewards as soon as possible, spending the least amount of energy. The solution is to think big in the long-term, but small in the short-term. The cumulative effect takes care of the rest.
	  Besides this tactic of how to act, you need a strategy (what to do, what not to do, how to avoid bad cumulative effects, how to promote good ones) and a direction (how you perceive reality, flexibility, self-compassion helps here, as do a psychologist).
	  Again, don't forget, motivation is temporary. Small changes and improvements every day are cumulative. It still takes energy, support even, which is where fitness, sports, talking to the people in your life, making new friends can help. You can't always do it on your own.
	- Start doing meditation, 1 min per day everyday and more when you feel like it. Start to go at the gym. Also start small, maybe 10 min every three days but never miss one session. Increase time and frequency when it’s appealing to you. Stop coffee and alcohol. Prioritize activities that are relaxing and/or energizing you. Walk. Relax. Don’t overthink, as thinking can not fix your issue.
	- Biggest change you can immediately make that will have a direct, positive impact - clean your apartment.
	  Doesn't have to be the whole thing. Focus on one manageable area or category, like laundry, bathrooms, vacuum, etc. Knock it out, then choose the next most logical (just swept? now mop).
	  Hard to get going at first, but once you start, sometimes it's just as hard to stop
	- Cleanup your room. Cleanup your appearance (hair, beard, cloths, etc).
	  Taking care of yourself reaffirms to your brain that you value yourself, and will get you moving again in the right direction.
	  If I may "guess" what's going on:
	  You are becoming a father but you weren't planning on it, or the mother is not the right person for you, but you feel obligated and so you have no choice?
	  First of all, you always have a choice. Do your duty, but do it out of your own volition, not out of fear of being seen in a negative light by society / parents / etc.
	  If you must, try doing things that would upset people whom scold you fear. Quit your job and try to find another one or become independent and work contracts while building up a business.
	  Do something that you believe in your gut is the right thing to do even though it will upset some people. You will feel such a relief. Now you can act out of your own volition.
	  Now, do this with every aspect of life. Do what you believe is right. Take people's input if you must, but own the decision and don't be afraid of their reactions.
	- Get physically active. You would need a LOT of energy to be around your son. I wish I was fitter when I became a father. That would have really helped.
	  Once you get more energy, things will fall into place. So keep that as your first priority
	- Scrolling through online feeds is an addiction.
	  Best thing seems to be to go cold turkey. Instead you could do something meditative (e.g. taking walks, sports) or something that allows you to enter a flow state (e.g. reading a book).
	  Getting out of bed can be difficult, so it's best done out of habit and without thinking.
	  Some pointers

	- Hey man, I totally know where you're coming from. I experienced burnout which led to depression. Boy did it not feel good. My will to live was at an all time low and I was also in a bad mood, felt completely disinterested in doing things. I was in denial though, and once it got to a breaking point I was able to surpass my internally held stigma against seeking help.
	  I ended up seeking a psychiatrist who put me on prozac and wellbutrin, and started doing weekly therapy. It helped a lot, and I'm doing much better these days and I am no longer on the medication, just doing talk therapy.
	  For you, I would say consider seeking help from a psychiatrist, and just talk to them. They won't always put you on medication.
	  But I think more importantly, you should look for a therapist that you like and helps you. I was fortunate to find a great one on my first try, but talking to my therapist just lets me air all my life grievances, feel heard, and helps me just let go of things that don't matter.
	  It sounds like your symptoms are different than mine, so I think it makes sense to seek help from a professional.
	  Best of luck, this is a great first step to seeking help though, best of luck OP.
	- When I was at a similar point I decided to commit myself to a physical practice. I didn’t know what it would be, but I knew changing my body and my relation to it would somehow unlock things. It’s going to look different for everyone, but for me I started by conquering my fear of swimming (early childhood trauma from drowning). I then started going to a gym, didn’t love it, but took some strength classes and did a lot of cardio on the rowing machine. I then fell into an intense physical yoga practice of 5x week for three years, which was life changing. Then I found myself training Muay Thai. Just find something that works for you and where your body is at. As a music teacher of mine said to me, there’s nothing wrong with being where you’re at, just keep practicing.
	  In the midst of all that I spent two years in therapy, during which time I wrote in a journal every day (based off of morning pages from the artist’s way). It was super helpful to have an established physical practice while working with a therapist, as a lot of stuff comes up and often times the best thing to do is to move it physically out of your body (check out “The Body Keeps the Score” if you haven’t yet).
	  But, don’t think too much about the whole path. Just start with a single commitment to something and keep walking.
	- First things first, do see a medical professional.
	  Secondly. I find I have to take quite a holistic approach to my life to keep on an even keel. Regular moderate exercise (whatever you enjoy and are likely to keep up, doesn't have to be much). Regular sleep schedule. Get outside lots, ideally in green spaces. The sun and elements on your face is really important. Clean up the diet too. Don't go crazy here but be sensible with sugar, reduce alcohol intake, reduce caffeine. Up the fruit and veg intake.
	  I also need a hobby or interest that really engages me. For me it's piano but finding something that recharges you and makes you feel switched on, really helps.
	  Other things that help me are relaxation exercises, doesn't have to be meditation, but something of that nature. Start to gently train your mind to unwind, bit by bit. Low intensity yoga is also excellent here.
	  Trying to foster self compassion, and compassion for those around you, can really dampen those low feelings for me too. Try to feel you are enough, you are suffering but doing your best, and we all share this nature. Suffering and compassion can connect you to others too.
	  Obviously, this is very personal advice. It depends on the specific underlying causes. As someone who has to deal with low energy, mood and some anxiety sometimes, but not acute mental illness, these have been life savers for me.
	- You're smart enough to ask for help, take on board the helpful comments and stay engaged.
	  Get out of the house for several hours a day, even if it is just walking around aimlessly, as it will give you perspective and clear your mind; the physical exercise won't hurt either.
	  This is something we all go through at some stage of our lives - it is normal, don't fall into the trap of thinking otherwise.
	- 1. Eat more fruits and vegetables. More varied diet helps in Vitamin and nutrition deficiency.
	  2. Go out on walks.
	  3. Do not take media to bed. Buy a good reading lamp + physical book or a kindle/remarkable.
	  4. Put your phone in Grayscale mode.
	  5. Go to a vacation. Even booking a hotel in same city for a Weekend will give you much needed break.

	- Go on a three week video game moratorium. Get on a regular sleep schedule that wakes you up earlier than normal. Make task todo lists. Make “intentions for the week” lists. Make the items small grains of sand sand. Tick them off as you finish some of them. It won’t be everything probably. Get yourself on a program of your choosing and it becomes a virtuous cycle.
	  Talk to someone too. Not commiserate, which isn’t helpful, but someone who could help or offer objective advice or just even understand you better after you say your piece.
	- Look in the mirror. Lay on the bed and stare at the ceiling. Phone an older relative, reflect on the history of your family. Stare outside the window. Take a walk through the town or the city; people-watch; understand that mostly everyone else feels the exact same way that you do, they just have better ways at masking it; you may be suggesting masks right now in fact.
	  Ask yourself honestly: What are the trends that characterize the strengths and weaknesses of my family’s lineage? What are the cycles? How do I break them? How do I organize around a new one that will protect my own children from how I feel? What is the objective for humanity, truly? Are we to merely eat, accumulate wealth, frolic and procreate like hares and squirrels? Protest, program and attempt to prolong our inevitable in-existence on earth?
	- Simplify your life. Start with a purge, get rid of stuff that clutters your life (including digital clutter) and make room for deliberate experiences. Go on walks, day hikes and spend more time outdoors.
	- top of the other answers that are really helpful, I would say to:
	- need a break. Nothing short of 2 whole weeks.
	  Give your mind and body chance to have a complete switch from the routine.
	  And it doesn't need to be a 'holiday' - a staycation can be far more relaxing than tiring, stressful, expensive travel.
	  Be intentional about not getting dragged into videos/games/services - read a physical book or two, walk, exercise. Go on dates, call family.
	  reply
	- time
	  Once I was volenteering, it was almost uncanny how I noticed I started going on many more meaningful dates, good prospective job interviews and strengthening/growing my social circles after a few months. Less time, but way more accomplished than when I was doing nothing. It was almost like I overcame the inertia of staying stagnant
	  "Oh, I have a date coming up tomorrow but I'm on the campaign trail now? No time to wallow or procrastinate about cleaning my apparment; I only have the time once I get back tonight. I'll do it without thinking"... that's how I noticed my prespective shifted durring that time

	- You need to see a psychiatrist for diagnosis and treatment. You are showing symptoms of depression. If you have depression, you can't get out of it by yourself -- you will need help. Fortunately, there are professionals standing by who have dedicated their lives to helping people just like you.
	  There can be biological causes for low mood and energy. I'll mention two.
	  The first is hypothyroidism (low thyroid). This comes on insidiously, with lower and lower levels over a span of years. Your energy gets lower and lower, slowly over time. Thyroid hormone is needed by every cell in your body to produce energy. Can be diagnosed with the TSH blood test (if above 3, suspect hypothyroidism).
	  The second is low testosterone, which can also be diagnosed with blood tests. It also develops insidiously. Testosterone has a powerful effect on the brain. A hundred years ago, testosterone was used as a therapy for depression (it worked).
	  Go see a doctor. You can't get out of it by yourself

	  > Losing the ability to relax and the feeling of self-control, over-indulging in endless feeds of videos, games and services that further drain the energy that I so crave to return. To a point where it feels more like an addiction, with my body now responding with physical discomforts and a relapse of anxiety that I have not felt for years.
	  This is the core problem in Stolen Focus by Johann Hari, probably a bunch of other books too. It's an unfair fight: you vs the behemoth companies that produce the addictive feeds. Worth a read IM
	- see you mention over indulging gaming. This provides one of the biggest dopamine hits, and if you're playing non stop everything else will be a bit dull (including the stuff you need to do in order to have a base happiness- exercise, eating well)
	  Pasting in a previous comment I put on here (I have no affiliation) ---
	  Purchase + install "cold turkey", you can set time blocks to play, or block months out entirely.
	  I used to game all the time, I now block games for 2-3 months, have a good weekend blow out and repeat.
