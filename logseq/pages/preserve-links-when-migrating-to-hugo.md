- I'm migrating my site to the Hugo static site generator.
- For now I'm publishing all of my posts under beta.briansunter.com
- I'm not going to switch my main domain over until I migrate all my old pages to my new site
- It's really important for the links to my site on other sites still work.
- My new hugo setup uses the main path `/page/` whereas my old setup uses `/blog`
- Thankfully, hugo let's me specify a url
