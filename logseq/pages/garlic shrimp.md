- The BEST Garlic Shrimp ever! It's just like the famous shrimp you buy at the food trucks in Hawaii. Made with succulent shrimp cooked in an extra garlicky, deliciously rich, butter based sauce.
- ### Ingredients
	- 1 lb. extra large shrimp, peeled and deveined
	- 1/4 cup (slightly packed) minced fresh garlic (nearly 1 medium head)
	- 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
	- 1 1/2 tsp paprika
	- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
	- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, diced into 1 Tbsp pieces
	- 2 Tbsp olive oil
	- 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
	- 1 Tbsp minced fresh parsley (optional)
- ### Instructions
	- Using papar towels, dab shrimp dry of excess moisture on both sides. Place in a bowl.
	- Sprinkle with flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt and pepper as desired. Toss to evenly coat.
	- Melt butter with olive oil in a large 12-inch non-stick skillet.
	- Add garlic and saute 30 seconds until nicely fragrant (but not browning!).
	- Add shrimp in an even layer in skillet. Cook on first side until pinkish color on bottom, about 2 minutes. Then flip and cook opposite side until just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer.
	- Remove from heat, toss with lemon and garnish with parsley if using.
	- Serve right away topped with extra garlic butter sauce from pan.
