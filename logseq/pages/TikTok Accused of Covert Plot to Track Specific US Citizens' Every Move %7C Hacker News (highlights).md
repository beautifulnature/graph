	- What the “TikTok is just doing what other social media companies are doing” response misses is that US platforms are under the purview of US law and US government.
	  The US govt’s extensive monitoring and archiving of its own citizens + foreign citizens information is widely known at this point.
	  This is a source of wide consternation for other foreign governments because the monitoring is a tremendous asset for US domestic and foreign intelligence, defense, and cyber warfare which is of course why China has banned many of these US services.
	  Meanwhile TikTok has grown like a weed in the US and several times the so called “firewall” supposed to keep the US version of TikTok separate had been demonstrably proven to be effectively non existent.
	  And considering the scale of election meddling, astroturfing, and psy ops that take place on US platforms - that both private industry and govt have failed to contain - the US intelligence community and govt likely well understands the threat of their unofficial, global arch rival owning the fastest growing new social media platform.
	  I would love to know what the intelligence community is doing behind closed doors at this point but they must have balanced TikTok as an asset vs liability given the obvious threat it poses to the US’ near ubiquitous control of global social media
