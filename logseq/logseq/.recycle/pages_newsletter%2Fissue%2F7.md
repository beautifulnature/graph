# Summary and Reflection 🤔
	- This week I wrote a post announcing my [new personal website]([[new website on logseq hugo]]).
	- I also wrote a post on [analysis of algorithms]([[posteriori-vs-a-priori-analysis-of-algorithms]])  for the algorithms-boot-camp.
	- This post focuses on the different ways of measuring algorithms theoretically and on actual hardware.
	- For some “brain food,” I share one of my favorite talks, “You and your Research” by Richard Hamming, and an announcement of a new Open Source image generation AI called “Stable Diffusion.”
# Updates 🆕
	- ### [[new website on logseq hugo]]
		- I launched a “beta” version of my website that’s built almost entirely in Logseq using the [Hugo Plugin](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
		- I write all my posts in Logseq and then push a button to export them to files compatible with the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
		- I’m still working on migrating my old pages and customizing them, but I’m pleased with the results so far.
		- [Read my post on it here](https://beta.briansunter.com/pages/new-website-on-logseq-hugo?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
		- The site,logseq graph, and AWS CDK deployment tooling[ is on Github.](https://github.com/briansunter/graph?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

		- [I wrote a post on posterior vs a priori analysis of algorithms](https://beta.briansunter.com/pages/posteriori-vs-a-priori-analysis-of-algorithms?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
		- As I watch various courses, I’ll [link to the concepts on the algorithms boot camp page](https://beta.briansunter.com/pages/algorithms-boot-camp?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) as a learning roadmap
# Productivity Toolkit 🛠️
	- In this section, I'll share a productivity tip I've learned recently.
	- ### [[five-minute-journal]]
		- The five-minute journal is one of the best places to start with journaling and productivity.
		- The idea is you just spend five minutes journaling every morning.
		- Here are the prompts I use:
			- What Am I Grateful for?
			- What Would Make Today Great?
			- What Am I Worried About?
		- [Read my post about it here.](https://beta.briansunter.com/blog/five-minute-journal?utm_campaign=newsletter-email&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
