		- Body
			- ## Getting started
				- Go to the logseq plugin marketplace and search for "openai" or update the plugin to get the latest version.
				- Press `CMD+g` to open the gpt3 popup
				- If you have your cursor inside a block, the popup will use the text in the block as input.
				- If the block is empty, it will run the command without any input.
				- For now, the input text in the block is inserted after the command you type.
				- If you are on a page and don't have a block selected, the plugin will append the output in a block at the bottom of the page, and won't use any text as input.
			- ## Freeform actions
				- You can open the popup and type in any task you want to perform.
				- For example, if you have a block of text and want to generate question and answer flashcards to help you remember important points, you could type
				- > create flash cards based on the following text:
				- ![custom-prompt.gif](../assets/custom-prompt_1674094160276_0.gif)
				- If you're in an empty block, you can ask it to do something without any input as well.

			- ## Built-in prompts
				- ![built-in-prompt-templates.gif](../assets/built-in-prompt-templates_1674096790451_0.gif)
				- There are a number of built in prompts for common use cases such as
					- Summarize Text
					- Fix Grammar
					- Create Outline
					- Extract Keywords
					- Write introduction
					- Find Keywords
					- Ask Questions
					- Find common objections to an idea
					- Most important ideas
					- Define
					- Find synonyms
					- Find antonyms
					- Create markdown table from text
					- Translate to other languages
				- ### Summarize Text
					- ![summarize.gif](../assets/summarize_1674095683669_0.gif)
				- ### Create outline of text
					- ![outline2.gif](../assets/outline2_1674095716959_0.gif)
			- ### Most important ideas in a text
				- ![important-ideas.gif](../assets/important-ideas_1674095953444_0.gif)
			- ### Common objections to an idea
				- ![common-objections.gif](../assets/common-objections_1674095797741_0.gif)
			- ## User-Defined commands
				- You can define your own commands to show up in the popup.
				- These are defined in a similar way as Logseq templates.
				- ### How to create a user-defined command
					- Create a block with a property `prompt-template:: Template Name`
					- Nest a block underneath the prompt template block that contains a codeblock of type `prompt`
					- #+BEGIN_SRC
					  # Student Teacher Dialog
					    prompt-template:: Student Teacher Dialog
					        ```prompt
					        Rewrite text as a dialog between a teacher and a student:
					        ```
					  #+END_SRC
