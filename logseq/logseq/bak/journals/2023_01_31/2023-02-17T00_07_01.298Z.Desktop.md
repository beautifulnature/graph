		- ## Preview
			- After you hit enter to run a command, the popup will show you a preview of the output from GPT-3, so you can decide if you want to insert it into your notes

		- ## Insert and Replace
			- After you run the command, you can either insert the GPT-3 result underneath the current block, or replace the current block with the GPT-3 result.
			- The replace feature is useful for improving the tone of existing writing, fixing grammar/spelling, and translation.
			- ### Replace example
				- ![replace translate autoplay](../assets/video_1675205191234_0.mp4)
		- ## Regenerate
			- Sometimes the first try doesn't generate optimal results, so you can click "Regenerate" to re-run the prompt until you get something good.

		- ## Share Prompts
			- Do you have a prompt that the community would find useful? Contribute it to the built-in prompts list
			- There's a TOML text file in the repo where you can easily add new prompts.
			- Go [here](https://github.com/briansunter/logseq-plugin-gpt3-openai/blob/master/src/prompts/prompts.toml) to see the prompt file in the repo

		- ## Future work
			- I have a number of enhancements in mind to add to the plugin.
			- The next features I'm planning are to add better support on which blocks to use as the command input, like sending an entire page or multiple selected blocks.
			- I also want to add some features that let your transform the input and output. For example, removing markdown from the input, and allowing you to split the output into multiple blocks
			- Eventually, I'd like to support sourcing blocks throughout your notes using embeddings.
			- I have a [Github Project](https://github.com/users/briansunter/projects/1/views/1) and [list of issues](https://github.com/briansunter/logseq-plugin-gpt3-openai/issues) to track ideas for features. Feel free to open an issue or contribute if you have an idea or find a bug!
