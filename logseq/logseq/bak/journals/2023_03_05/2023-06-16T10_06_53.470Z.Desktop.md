	- # Job Sequencing with Deadlines
		- {{video https://youtu.be/zPtI8q9gvX8}}
		- |Jobs|J1|J2|J3|J4|J5|
		  |--|--|--|--|--|--|
		  |Profit|20|15|10|5|1|
		  |Deadlines |2|2|1|3|3|
		- We are given 5 jobs (tasks) and if the task is completed, we will get a given profit
		- We must finish the job within a deadline
		- Assume each job takes on unit of time to complete
		- How do we decide which order to do the jobs?
		- {{youtube-timestamp 217}} We want a set of jobs that can be completed in their deadlines, so that the profit is maximized
		- Optimization problem - maximize profit
		- Constraint - must be within deadline
		- We have an optimization problem with a constraint, so we can use the greedy method
		- How many hours are available?
		- From the 0th hour to last hour, is 3 hours, so we have 3 units of time total available
		- We can only do at most 3 out of 5 jobs
		- Applying greedy method, we will select jobs in order of their maximum profit
		- Select the highest profit job, J1 when should we do it? the latest available slot
		- Select next highest job, J2, When can we do it? in the first slot
		- Try selecting the next job, J3, no available time slots, so skip
		- Select J4, valid, so add it in the third slot
		- So we select jobs [J2,J1,J4] to do
		- We can complete these in more than one sequence
		- Total profit is 40
		- Note: make sure to sort in order of highest profit
