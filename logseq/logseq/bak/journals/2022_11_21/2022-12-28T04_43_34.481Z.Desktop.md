	- ### IBM Deep Blue vs Google Alpha Go Zero
		- IBM's Deep Blue chess engine was the first computer to beat a chess world champion. It heavily relied pre programmed rules, such as a database of opening moves and endgame moves chosen by chess experts
		- Google's AlphaGoÂ was the first computer program to defeat a professional Go player.
		- Alpha Go Zero has fewer built in rules, and relies more on a technique called "reiniforcement learning", where it becomes it's own teacher by playing millions of games against itself. It starts with no knowledge about how to play the game, except basic rules
