- Single source shortest path in a weighted graph
- Find the shortest path from a single source to all vertices
- Therefore it's a minimization problem, an optimization problem, that can be solved by the greedy method
- Algorithm works on directed and non directed graphs

- Basic procedure
	- First select shortest path vertex
	- After selecting shortest path, then check from that vertex if there are shortest paths to other vertices
	- In the case above, there's a shortest path of total weight 6
- # Relaxation
	- ```js
	  if (d[u]+c(u,v) <d[v]){
	    d[v] = d[u] + c(u,v)
	  }
	  ```
- It can work on nondirected graph too, just have equal weights in opposite directions
- Keep a record of the distance to each vertex, select the shortest weight at each step
- At each step, update the connected vertices based on the "relaxation rule"
- Also works with negative weights and edges, might not work if there are negative edges
