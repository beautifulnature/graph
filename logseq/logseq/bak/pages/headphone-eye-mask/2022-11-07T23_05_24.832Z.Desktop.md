- ## Why are you staying up so late?
	- You likely have a combination of "revenge bedtime procrastination" and messing up your circadian rhythm with bright light exposure before bed.
- ## Revenge Bedtime Procrastination
	- <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learned a very relatable term today: “報復性熬夜” (revenge bedtime procrastination), a phenomenon in which people who don’t have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early in order to regain some sense of freedom during late night hours.</p>&mdash; daphne (@daphnekylee) <a href="https://twitter.com/daphnekylee/status/1277101831693275136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
	- If you find yourself struggling to fall asleep at night, you may be a victim of revenge bedtime procrastination. This is when you stay up late to do something that you know you shouldn't be doing, like watching television or scrolling through social media.
	- I tell myself, "I'll just watch one more episode" or "I'll just read a few more articles."
	- You know you should be asleep hours ago but you just can’t seem to drift off. You keep scrolling through your phone, checking the news, scrolling some more. You’re stuck in a doomscrolling cycle and you can’t seem to break out of it.
	- It's a common problem in our 24/7 world, where we're always connected and there's always something new to consume. A [survey from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://aasm.org/are-you-tiktok-tired-93-of-gen-z-admit-to-staying-up-past-their-bedtime-due-to-social-media/) found that **93% of Gen Z have lost sleep because they stayed up “past their bedtime” to view or participate in social media.**
- ## Circadian Rhythm
	- Circadian Rhythm is the 24-hour internal clock that dictates things like hormones and energy and when we feel awake or sleepy.
	- Bright light from electronics is terrible for your natural sleep cycles. Studies have shown that exposure to bright light before bed can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
	- <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">However, due to circadian shifts in retinal sensitivity, once night time rolls around, you can easily suppress melatonin production &amp; alter your circadian clock by viewing light that is too bright (any color, not just blue light). Thus, best to avoid bright lights ~10pm to 4am.</p>&mdash; Andrew D.

- ### Headphone Eye Mask
	- So what's the solution?
	- Listening to podcasts with a headphone eye mask
	- If you're not familiar, a headphone eye mask is an eye mask with built-in bluetooth headphones. You can listen to a podcast while wearing the eye mask, which blocks out all light.
	- These are flat and go over your ears, which I prefer instead of having airpods inside my ears or large headphones over my ears.
	- Simply coercing yourself to go to bed early is hard, so I prefer to replace my doomscrolling with a healthier habit that I look forward to before bed.
	- Putting on the mask cuts off your access to distractions, signals to the brain it's time for bed, and makes it easier to focus on winding down for the night.
	- I've found audio content slows down my brain compared to reactive scrolling.
	- 30 minutes before I want to go to bed, I put on a podcast with a sleep timer, so it shuts off after an hour, and listen to it while I drift off to sleep.

	- My favorite type of audio content is podcast interviews but is a huge range of audio content available, including podcasts specifically meant for falling asleep.
	- You won't fully absorb the content if you're listening to it while falling asleep, so I usually re-listen to it on my morning walk the next day.
	- I don't listen to audiobooks, since those are a bit more stimulating and require more attention to follow.
	- If you're struggling to get a good night's sleep, give a headphone eye mask a try. It just might be the key to breaking your cycle of bedtime procrastination and getting the rest you need.
