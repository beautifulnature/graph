	- Organizing notes and information is a challenge. Traditional methods like folders and tagging fall short because they require continuous manual effort to keep organized. What if we could leverage recent advances in machine learning to organize these notes automatically?
	- At the same time, we have modern computing capable of rendering rich 3D environments. Yet, most application interfaces are still confined to a 2D plane.
	- This post is an experiment that leverages machine learning text embeddings to organize Wikipedia articles in a 3D space within your browser.
	- ## Text Embeddings: A Primer
		- Text embeddings are lists of numbers generated by machine learning algorithms to capture the "semantic meaning" of textual data.
		- In machine learning, capturing semantic meaning involves understanding the context in which words or phrases are used within the text. This enables algorithms to differentiate between words with multiple meanings, identify synonyms, and understand nuances, making the machine's text interpretation closer to human understanding.
		- For example, "Text embeddings" could understand that the words "King" and "Queen" are similar, whereas "King" and "Dog" are not similar.
	- ## Text embeddings in 3D
		- After turning Wikipedia articles into text embeddings, it's possible to use an algorithm called UMAP to plot the articles in 3D or 2D space. In this graph, the articles closest to each other in 3D space are most similar.
	- ## The Dataset
		- The experiment features two datasets: [Wikipedia's 1000 "Level 3 Vital Articles"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles) and [10,000 "Level 4 Vital Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles/Level/4)."
		- These lists are articles that Wikipedia thinks are most essential. They're manually categorized into subjects like history, people, geography, and science.
		- You can toggle between these in the demo, but showing the large graph with 10,000 articles requires a fast computer.
	- ## The Result
		- As expected, the text embeddings naturally cluster the Wikipedia articles into similar groups, mimicking their manual categorizations.
		- However, the 3D space allows for more fluid categorizations, enabling articles to exist "between groups." For instance, the "Philosophy of Science" article is placed between a cluster of articles on science and a cluster of articles on philosophy.
	- ## Implications and Uses
		- ### Dynamic Categorization
			- The 3D space allows for a dynamic, fluid way to categorize notes or articles. Unlike rigid folder structures, this method enables an article to belong to multiple overlapping categories or in between categories.
			- As new articles are added, all articles shift and reorganize themselves around the new articles, so no manual organization is necessary. It's organized based on the meaning of the content
		- ### Discovery and Exploration
			- The 3D environment encourages users to explore information in a more engaging manner, potentially leading to unexpected yet relevant findings.
			- Since the collections are suggested by the machine and not formed manually, you're more likely to discover new links and connections between information.
		- ### Semantic Search
			- Text embeddings are also used to implement "Semantic Search," which allows you to search for documents based on similarity instead of keywords.
			- The 3D gives us an intuitive understanding of how search works; we could imagine the search term in 3D space, and the search results would be the closest articles to the search query.
	- ### Real-world Application
		- The primary focus of this experiment is Wikipedia. However, this method can extend to personal or corporate knowledge bases. It's a unique alternative for exploring and discovering information information.
		- With the potential rise in popularity of devices such as Apple Vision, the importance of crafting 3D interfaces could surge significantly.
	- ### Conclusion
		- The experiment shows the potential of combining text embeddings with 3D interfaces for information management. It not only simplifies the organization but also enriches the exploration and retrieval experience.
		- As we continue to generate and consume more information, self-organizing approaches could be the key to managing this ever-growing digital world.
