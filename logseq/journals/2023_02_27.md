	- {{youtube-timestamp 35}} This method is used for optimization problems
	- Optimization problems require minimum result or maximum result
	- For example, you may want to travel from location A to location B, minimizing the time
	- There are many potential solutions, like flying, driving, or walking, but you want to choose the one to minimize the time
	- You may have a constraint like it takes less than 12 hours, so the solutions that satisfy those limitations are called "feasible solutions"
	- Minimization problems ask you to find the minimum cost
	- The solution with the minimum cost is called the "optimal solution"
	- There can only be one optimal solution, although there may be other possible solutions
	- If a problem requires either minimum or maximum result, you call it an optimization problem
	- ## Terms
		- feasible - satisfies some constraint
		- Optimal solutions - satisfies objective which is minimum or maximum result
		- Optimization problem - asks for a maximum or minimum result
	- ## Methods to solve optimization problems
		- Greedy method
		- Dynamic Programming
		- Branch and bound
	- # General method of greedy method
		- {{youtube-timestamp 389}} The problem should be solved in stages
		- In each stage you will consider an input, and if that input is feasible, you will include it in the solution
		- ```js
		  function greedy(arr,n){
		    for (let a of arr){
		      const x = select(a);
		      if (isFeasible(x)){
		        solution = solution + x;
		      }
		    }
		  }
		  ```

	- You could look at all the models of cars, then select the best one based on your criteria
	- # Knapsack Problem - Greedy
		- {{video https://youtu.be/oTTzNMHM05I}}
		- You are given some objects, and each object has profit and weight
		- You are given a bag with a weight capacity, such as 15kg
		- You need to fill the bags with objects, carry it to some other location, and sell it
		- {{youtube-timestamp 118}} How can you fill the container so you maximize the profits
		- Since we're trying to maximize the profits, it's an optimization problem
		- We can use the greedy method
		- The constraint is the bag can only hold 15kg
		- {{youtube-timestamp 188}} If you say put every object in the bag, the problem isn't feasible, because it's too heavy
		- To represent if an object is included, we can have an array of elements 0-1
		- This problem allows for taking fractions of an object, so the objects are divisible
		- {{youtube-timestamp 275}} For example, think about a bag of potatoes where you can only take part of the bag of potatoes
		- ## Example Problem
			- 7 objects
			- 15 is the maximum weight
			- if having an array of possible objects `[[profit,weight]]`
			- `[[10,2],[5,3],[15,5],[7,7],[6,1],[18,4],[3,1]]`
			- {{youtube-timestamp 387}} If allowing fractions, select projects with the highest profit by weight
			- Calculate profit by weight for each object
			- profit by weight, profit/weight for each object = `[5,1.3,3,1,6,4.5,3]`
			- Put the highest profit by weight into the bag first
			- {{youtube-timestamp 477}} The 5th object is the highest profit by weight, so include it in the bag first.
			- The profit is 6 and weight is 1, so we have 14 kg remaining
			- The 1st object has profit by weight of 5, so we include it
			- The 1st object has weight of 2, so we have 12 kg remaining
			- {{youtube-timestamp 501}} The 6th object has profit by weight of 4.5 and weight of 4
			- We include it and have 8kg remaining
			- Third object has 3 porfit by weight and weight of 5, so we include it and have 3 kg remaining
			- The 7th object also has 3 profit by weight, and weight of 1, so we include it and have 2kg remaining
			- The 2nd object has 1.3 profit per weight so we include it next
			- It has a total weight of 3, but we only have 2 kg remaining, so we include 2kg of it, and leave the remaining
			- The solution is `[1,.33,1,0,1,1,1]`
			- Add up the fractions of included objects * profit
			- {{youtube-timestamp 687}} `10+.33+15+0+6+18+3` = 54.6 total profit, which is the maximum profit and optimal solution
			- Remember, the constraint is the total weight of the objects in the bag is less than the bags  capacity
			- 0/1 knapsack problem is when the objects are indivisible, which has a different approach
