	- ### Why build a second brain?
		- We spend a lot of energy consuming content, but we hardly spend any time reflecting on it and turning it into something useful.

		- [[gpt3]] Tiago Fortes' Building a Second Brain is about developing a comprehensive productivity system by curating and synthesizing information from multiple sources and composing knowledge from it. It focuses on helping people better manage their information, as well as improve their creativity, productivity, and ability to generate insights.
	- We spend so much time consuming content, but hardly any time applying that knowledge
	- Instead of trying to keep everything in your head, start writing it down, where it's easier to remember and take action on later.
	- Taking notes is a way of building compounding interest from your ideas.
	- Taking notes and technology isn't just for storing information, but a tool for thinking
	- There's a long history of taking notes, such as the biji in ancient china, which is a notebook where scholars kep anectdones, quotes, random musing, literary criticism, fictional stories, and anything else they found interesting. Japan had something imilar called a zuihitsu
	- # Benefits of a Second Brain
		- ## Make our ideas concrets
			- Writing things down removes the burden of remembering
			- Getting ideas out of your head makes it easier to rearrange, edit, and combine them
		- ## Reveal associations between ideas
			- The essence of creativity is making connections between ideas, especially ideas that don't seem to be connected
			- When we keep diverse material in one place, we make it easier to form interesting connections
			- We might have ancient philosophy quotes, next to tweets blog posts, and youtube videos.
		- ## Incubate ideas over time
			- When faced with a task, it's hard to start completely from scratch
			- What are the chances that the ideas you come with on the spot will be the best ones?
			- It's better to have an existing network of ideas to draw on that you've already been thinking about for a long time
		- ## Sharpening our perspectives
			- The ultimate purpose of the second brain isn't to just gather others ideas, but shapen your own thinking
			- If you feel like your creative well has run dry, examples, illustrations, stories, quotes, and mindmaps can help you
	- # Code Method
		- Code is a four step process to capture, organize, and make use of ideas
		- ## Capture
			- You can capture
