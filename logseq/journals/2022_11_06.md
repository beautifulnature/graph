		  Why are you staying up so late?
		  Revenge bedtime procrastination
		  I often find myself consuming useless content for an hour or more before going to bed. This
		- is especially true when I'm stressed or have been working long hours. It's a way to procrastinate going to bed. I tell myself, "I'll just watch one more episode" or "I'll just read a few more articles."
		  
		  But that's a mistake.
		  
		  Not only is this doomscrolling bad for your mental health, but it's also terrible for your sleep. Staring at screens late at night messes with your circadian rhythm, making it harder to fall asleep and get a good night's rest.
		  
		  So what's the solution?
		  
		  Listening to a podcast with a headphone eye mask
		  I've started listening to podcasts with a headphone eye mask, and it's been game-changing.
		  
		  If you're not familiar, a headphone eye mask is an eye mask with built-in headphones. You can listen to a podcast while wearing the eye mask, which blocks out all light.
		  
		  This has two major benefits.
		  
		  First, it allows you to avoid doomscrolling before bed. You can still listen to your favorite podcast, but you're not looking at a screen. This means you're not exposing yourself to blue light, which is known to disrupt your circadian rhythm.
		  
		  Second, listening to a podcast with a headphone eye mask can help you fall asleep. If you're struggling to fall asleep, try listening to a podcast that's boring or monotonous. I like to listen to history podcasts because they put me to sleep within minutes.
		  
		  If you're looking for a way to improve your sleep and fix your circadian rhythm, try wearing a headphone eye mask to bed. It's a simple hack that can make a big difference.
		- When it comes to getting a good night's sleep, there are a lot of things that can stand in your way. One of the biggest culprits is light exposure at night, which can disrupt your body's natural circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
		  
		  One simple way to combat this is to wear a headphone eye mask to bed. This will block out any artificial light and help you get the deep, restful sleep your body needs.
		  
		  There are other benefits to wearing a headphone eye mask as well. For one, it can help to muffle any noise that might be keeping you up at night. And if you tend to lie in bed scrolling through your phone before you fall asleep, the eye mask can help discourage that habit by making it harder to see your screen.
		  
		  So if you're struggling to get a good night's sleep, give a headphone eye mask a try. It just might be the key to finally getting the rest you need.
		- Wearing a headphone eye mask to bed can prevent doomscrolling, revenge bedtime procrastination and fix your circadian rhythm.

When it's dark, your SCN tells your body it's time to sleep.
		  
		  Staying up late throws off your SCN, which can lead to all sorts of health problems, including insomnia, obesity, and depression. It can also make you feel like you're in a permanent state of jet lag.
