- what is a recurrence relation in algorithms
	- [[gpt3]] A recurrence relation is a mathematical equation which describes a sequence of values, each of which is defined by the value of its previous term. Recurrence relations are a type of algorithms used in data analysis, as they can represent a sequence of values in a succinct and computable way.
