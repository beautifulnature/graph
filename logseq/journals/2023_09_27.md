- Semantic search considers the context and intent of a search query rather than just focusing on individual keywords. For instance, if you were to type "why is the sky blue?" into a search engine, traditional keyword-based search might simply look for pages that contain the words "sky" and "blue". 
  
  However, semantic search would understand that you're looking for pages explaining the scientific reason behind the sky's blue color. Even though the exact wording might not always appear on those pages - for instance, an article might talk about "light scattering" or "Rayleigh scattering" without explicitly stating "why is the sky is blue" - a semantic search algorithm can still surface this page because it understands the concept and the intent behind your query. 
  
  This is possible because semantic search makes links between associated concepts and ideas, rather than just word matching. So in a semantic search system, the aim is to deliver the information the user is actually looking for, rather than just pages that happen to feature the keywords mentioned in the query.
- Semantic search prioritizes understanding the context and intent behind a query. For example, if you look up "Oscar-winning mystery movies," you might get results for "The Usual Suspects" even if the actual words "Oscar," "winning," "mystery," and "movies" aren't explicitly stated on the webpage for "The Usual Suspects." This is because semantic search would understand that "The Usual Suspects" is a movie that won an Oscar and that it fits the broader genre of mystery, despite these keywords not being directly used in the search query.
