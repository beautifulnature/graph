		- I'm really interested in learning about AI but it's extremely difficult to know where to get started or what to focus on.
		- I have a lot of questions such as:
		- How much math do I need and which types?
		- What areas of machine learning should I focus on?
		- How does all the topics fit together and relate with eacother?
		- Which tools are best?
		- What direction is the industry headed in?
		- I have a background as a traditional software engineer with some math knowledge.
		- My goal is to gain a practical understanding of machine learning to the point where I can solve problems.
		- Some of the areas that are interesting to me are generative AI, natural language processing, and intelligent agents
		- I also want to gain enough math skills to have a relatively deep understanding of the underlying processes, yet not too deep.

			- Are you interested in learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) but don't know where to start? Struggling to figure out how much math you need to know, which areas of machine learning to focus on, and how all the topics fit together? With a background in traditional software engineering and some knowledge of mathematics, I am on a mission to gain a practical understanding of machine learning and solve related problems. This journey has led me to explore topics such as generative AI, natural language processing, and intelligent agents. I want to gain sufficient math skills to have a fairly deep understanding of the underlying processes, while still allowing some room to learn more. Join me as I try to answer questions such as "Which tools are best?" and "What direction is the industry headed in?" as I embark on this journey of learning AI.
			- Are you interested in learning AI but not sure where to start or what to focus on? I have the same questions and I'm here to answer them. I'm a software engineer with a bit of mathematical knowledge and my goal is to gain a practical understanding of machine learning so I can solve problems. I'm particularly interested in generative AI, natural language processing, and intelligent agents. My goal is to gain enough math skills to have a deep understanding of the underlying processes but not get too bogged down in details. In this post, I will explore the many questions surrounding AI, from what math is needed to which tools are most beneficial and what direction the industry is headed. With this information, I hope to provide a step by step guide to gaining a deep understanding of machine learning.
			- As a traditional software engineer with some math knowledge, I'm eager to level up my skillset and learn more about AI. But the amount of resources and research in the field can be overwhelming! Where do I start and what should I focus on? How much math do I need, what are the best tools, and which areas of machine learning should I focus on? With so many questions, I'm setting out to gain a practical understanding of AI, with a focus on generative AI, natural language processing, intelligent agents, and enough math to have a relatively deep understanding of the underlying processes. My goal is to gain enough knowledge and skills to be able to solve problems in the AI field.
			- With the ever-growing prevalence of AI within our daily lives, it is becoming increasingly important to have a firm grasp on the concepts and technologies related to the field. As someone with a background in software engineering and some familiarity with mathematics, I am eager to gain practical knowledge of AI while also deepening my understanding of the underlying processes. My plan is to focus on understanding more about generative AI, natural language processing, and intelligent agents. But before I can do that, I have several questions in need of answers: How much math do I need and what types? Where should I focus my machine learning studies? What tools are best? What direction is the industry heading? With the help of the best AI learning resources, I hope to find answers to all of these questions, and ultimately come away with the skills necessary to solve problems with AI.
