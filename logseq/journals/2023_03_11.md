	- # [[chatgpt vs gpt-3]]
		- OpenAI recently released their ChatGPT API.
		- You've probably heard of the ChatGPT web app, but now developers can build applications on top of the ChatGPT technology
		- One of the most notable things about the ChatGPT API is that it's 90% cheaper than the earlier models they provide over API such as GPT-3 text-davinci-003
		- Before, I was spending around $7 a month on GPT-3 with moderate usage for my personal notetaking purposes, but now I'm expecting to spend less than a dollar per month with the cheaper ChatGPT API.
		- Even though they called it "chat" GPT, OpenAI says it's as good as davinci-003 for non chat use cases and single actions tasks. They recommend using it for most use cases
		- I recently updated the Logseq OpenAI GPT-3 plugin to use ChatGPT by default, so hopefully users will spend 90% less while still getting just as good answers.
		- ## Differences
			- OpenAI highlights in their [blog posts](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) that the model is "safer" and less likely to make up answers to questions.
			- By safer, they mean it's less likely to generate harmful output. For example, if you ask ChatGPT how to break into someone's house, it will refuse to answer.
			- If you ask it "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015", it will identify that the question doesn't make sense, whereas earlier models will not.
			- I've been using it as a replacement for the davinci language model, and it works as well for most use of the same use cases, however there are some downsides.
		- ## As a language model...
			- One of the biggest differences I notice is that ChatGPT is more conversational, and often adds things like "As a language model" or other dialog, whereas davinci will answer the question directly.
			- I also noticed that the model will refuse to answer subjective questions more often, whereas earlier models will attempt to answer.
		- ## Tests
			- What is the best form of government?
			  collapsed:: true
				- There isn't a single "best" form of government, as the success of a government largely depends on the needs and values of the people it governs. Different societies may require different forms of government based on their unique history, culture, and social conditions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a government depends on the competence and ethical behavior of its leaders and officials, as well as its ability to balance individual rights and the common good. Ultimately, the best form of government is one that can adapt and evolve to meet the changing needs of its citizens while upholding democratic principles and ensuring stability and prosperity.
				- There is no one best form of government, as different forms of government are better suited to different countries and contexts. Ultimately, it depends on the unique needs and wants of the citizens of each country and the type of political environment they desire.

			- describe a steel inquisitor from mistborn book
			  collapsed:: true
				- As an AI language model, I cannot have opinions or make assumptions. However, I can provide you with a general description of a Steel Inquisitor from Mistborn book. 
				  
				  Steel Inquisitors are terrifying and powerful creatures created by the Lord Ruler to serve and enforce his reign. They are former humans who have been extensively modified, both physically and mentally, with spikes of metal driven through their eyes, head, and body, granting them immense power and abilities.
				  
				  Physically, a Steel Inquisitor is terrifying to behold, with metallic spikes protruding from their flesh and glowing red eyes. They are nearly invulnerable to physical harm and can heal incredibly quickly from most injuries. Their reflexes and strength are also superhuman, making them formidable opponents in battle.
				  
				  Mentally, Steel Inquisitors are completely loyal to the Lord Ruler and will stop at nothing to carry out his will. They can sense the use of Allomancy (the magic system in Mistborn) and can track down those who use it, making them a constant threat to the group of rebels trying to overthrow the Lord Ruler.
				  
				  In short, a Steel Inquisitor is a terrifying and powerful being, feared by all who know of their existence, including the protagonists of the Mistborn series.
				- The Steel Inquisitor is a deadly and sly figure from Mistborn. His black steel armor and an exaggeratedly-feathered helmet make a powerful impression, and the Inquisitor's silent, intimidating presence can fill a room. He's a swift fighter and has enhanced reflexes, allowing him to dodge and avoid the most powerful of blows. His preferred weapons are two long, scimitar-like swords and a toxin-filled syringe hidden in his wrist. He is loyal to Lord Ruler and follows his every order without question. He often appears unexpectedly to catch people off-guard, and he also takes pleasure in toying with his victims, even as he kills them. People are usually scared of him, primarily because he's known to show little or no mercy when on duty.

				- Deep learning neural networks, or artificial neural networks, attempts to mimic the human brain through a combination of data inputs, weights, and bias. These elements work together to accurately recognize, classify, and describe objects within the data.
				  Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each building upon the previous layer to refine and optimize the prediction or categorization. This progression of computations through the network is called forward propagation. The input and output layers of a deep neural network are called *visible *layers. The input layer is where the deep learning model ingests the data for processing, and the output layer is where the final prediction or classification is made. Another process called backpropagation* *uses algorithms, like gradient descent, to calculate errors in predictions and then adjusts the weights and biases of the function by moving backwards through the layers in an effort to train the model. Together, forward propagation and backpropagation allow a neural network to make predictions and correct for any errors accordingly. Over time, the algorithm becomes gradually more accurate.

					- ### Common Objections
						- [[davinci]] Objections:
						  
						  1. Deep learning neural networks require large amounts of data and computing power, making it cost prohibitive for many businesses.
						  2. Training and tuning neural networks can be complicated and time-consuming.
						  3. Deep learning models can be complicated, can be opaque, and can be difficult to explain to stakeholders.
						  4. Neural networks are susceptible to overfitting, resulting in inaccurate predictions.
						  5. Neural networks may not recognize subtle nuances that a human is able to detect.
						- [[chatgpt]] 1. Lack of transparency: One of the common objections to deep learning neural networks is that they are often considered to be a "black box." This means that it can be difficult to fully understand how the algorithms work, and there is little transparency on how the models are making their predictions or classifications.
						  
						  2. High computational requirements: Deep learning neural networks require significant computational resources, such as powerful GPUs, to process large amounts of data. This high computational requirement can often be a barrier for smaller organizations or individuals.
						  
						  3. Overfitting: Another potential objection to deep learning neural networks is the risk of overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and starts to fit the noise in the training data instead of the true patterns. This can lead to poor performance when tested on new data.
						  
						  4. Limited interpretability: Deep learning neural networks can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why certain decisions or classifications are being made. This lack of interpretability can be especially problematic in certain industries where transparency is necessary (e.g., finance, healthcare).
						  
						  5. Data bias: Deep learning neural networks are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, the model will also be biased. This can perpetuate inequalities and perpetuate systemic biases.
					- ### Find Contradictions
						- [[davinci]] Contradiction: Input and output layers are called visible layers, yet backpropagation moves backwards through the layers.
