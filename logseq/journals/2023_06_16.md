		- **Introduction to the 3D Viewport**: This is the main workspace in Blender where users will spend most of their time. It contains objects like cubes, lamps, and cameras. The instructor explains the difference between the 3D viewport and the rendered image, which includes lighting information.
		- -
		- **Basic Manipulation**: The instructor teaches how to move, rotate, and scale objects using hotkeys (G for grab/move, R for rotate, S for scale). He also explains how to constrain these actions along specific axes (X, Y, Z).
		- -
		- **Navigating the Viewport**: The tutorial covers how to orbit (middle mouse button), pan (shift + middle mouse button), and zoom (scroll wheel or control + middle mouse button) in the viewport. The instructor also explains how to focus on a selected object using the number pad period key.
		- -
		- **Aligning View to Axis**: The instructor shows how to align the view to the front, side, or top using the number pad keys (1 for front, 3 for side, 7 for top). He also explains the difference between orthographic and perspective modes (toggle with number pad 5).
		- -
		- **Properties and Outliner**: The right-hand side of the Blender interface contains the properties of objects in the 3D viewport and an outliner, which is a list of all objects in the scene.
		- **Blender Features:**
		- 3D Viewport: The main workspace in Blender where users spend most of their time.
		- Properties: Located on the right-hand side of the Blender interface, it contains the properties of objects in the 3D viewport.
		- Outliner: Also located on the right-hand side, it's a list of all objects in the scene.
		- Rendered Image: A snapshot from the camera view with lighting information.
		- Orthographic Mode: A view mode with no depth, useful for aligning views.
		- Perspective Mode: A view mode with depth, more similar to how the human eye sees.
		- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
		- G: Grab/Move an object.
		- R: Rotate an object.
		- S: Scale an object.
		- X, Y, Z: Constrain movement, rotation, or scale along specific axes.
		- Middle Mouse Button: Orbit in the viewport.
		- Shift + Middle Mouse Button: Pan in the viewport.
		- Scroll Wheel or Control + Middle Mouse Button: Zoom in/out in the viewport.
		- Number Pad Period: Focus on a selected object.
		- Number Pad 1: Align view to the front.
		- Number Pad 3: Align view to the side.
		- Number Pad 7: Align view to the top.
		- Number Pad 5: Toggle between orthographic and perspective modes.
		- Shift + D: Duplicate an object.
		- X or Delete: Delete an object.
		- Number Pad 0: Look through the camera view.
		- Alt + Middle Mouse Button: Snap to the nearest axis while orbiting.
